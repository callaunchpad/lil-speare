trendsetter ben frank getter 
whip whatever whip whatever
i buy diamonds when i'm under pressure 
when i apply it shit dont ever let up yeah
look i'm in the cut the boy in the cut
jump in the whip where the ceilings go up we up
all of this grindin' for what
its funny when you niggas thought it was luck
i cannot give you a pass if you play with my money and family and friends
and i compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
your foreign is used i looked up the vin
i know the truth no use in pretendin' with him
still in the cut the boy in the cut
hop in the whip where the ceilings go up we up
and i'm way up at the top of the loft
gotta stay up ain't no knockin' me off
pull up smooth ai with the cross 
countin' up wins on wins on wins for all of my dawgs i lost
i might call pharrell get the new chanel
thugger got the ysl huh
i remember when the feds did the sweep i pray my dawgs didn't tell huh
cruisin down biscayne
i was in miami she gave me top with the top off
cartier wrist gang got her a audemar
she got the head knock your socks off
you aint gettin' money you aint fuckin' with me
you ain't in your bitch top five
i might pull up in the six with drizzy
i was just in houston fuckin' with the mob ties
we dont never ever play two sides
hang out the phantom it's suicide
they ridin' my wave like a rogue tide
my necklace is wet like the poolside
still in the cut the boy in the cut yeah
hop in the whip where the ceilings go up we up
you ask how many girls i been with in my life
i tell ya i stopped keeping count when i was 25
i ask you the same thing you tell me seven guys
but we both know that's a lie
'cause if we countin' head and if we countin' drunken nights
then that number that you gave just might be off by eight or nine
but it's still nowhere close to mine
marcus prolly had to bring me straps like thirty times
he took over like four years ago when courtne had resigned
i been talkin' sex with courtne since like 2005
we been friends since junior high
tough to enjoy the company and never cross the line
she's like is it more than a hundred with everyone combined
and i say yeah that's bein' kind
at one point or another they all felt like they were mine
i had a lot of backs that i would never talk behind
i'm not really into threesomes i like one thing at a time
i like when it's you and i
plus i always feel like if somebody outperforms you
that could jeopardize your pride and i'm not into choosin' sides
unless you 'bout to sleep and you askin' me what's my side
it's the right at home but this a hotel so you can decide
lessons that i learned before hittin' my prime
confessions that i blame on the zodiac sign
things you need to hear 'fore we say our goodbyes
free myself of it all watch a scorpio rise
yeah
you say you wanna know but you don't though
why you wanna know who i cropped out of photos
and lately papi you been acting tonto
what you think before you i was only movin' dolo
but i'm honest 'til i die so i won't lie
and i prolly got some numbers that you won't like
and you're prolly gonna hate it
but i much rather be hated for the truth than for the wrong guy if he ain't done
you can't be this good without some badness
what you think i fuck this good without some practice
and if it's lov and you're my mvp
then why we talkin' about practice
like you want me to lie
why would i jeopardize my worth just to value your pride
confessions that i blame on the zodiac sign
'cause then i switch up and i blame it on my gemini
might be jealousy 'cause you just want me tradin' lives
jealousy 'cause i can get the girls and get the guys
and if i'm honest this whole convo's just a waste of time
'cause legacy should be my focus not here playin' wife
woah woah
yeah
sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but i guess you know now baby
i took a half and she took the whole thing slow down baby
we took a trip now we on your block and it's like a ghost town baby
where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that
tired of beefin' you bums you can't even pay me enough to react
been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes i don't even know where i'm at
please don't play that nigga songs in this party i can't even listen to that
anytime that i ran into somebody it must be a victory lap ayy
shawty come sit on my lap ayy they sayin' drizzy just snap
distance between us is not like a store this isn't a closeable gap ayy
i've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back
i know that they at the crib goin' crazy down bad
what they had didn't last damn baby
sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but i guess you know now baby
i took a half and she took the whole thing slow down baby
we took a trip now we on your block and it's like a ghost town baby
where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that
i'm in the trenches relax
can you not play that lil' boy in the club 'cause we do not listen to rats
we in atlanta i buy her a wig she tellin' me tae is the best
point at the nigga who act like a killer but you only one from the 'net
i'm like dababy i'm not just a rapper you play with me you gon' get stretched

what they had didn't last damn baby
sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry but i guess you know now baby
i took a half and she took the whole thing slow down baby
we took a trip now we on your block and it's like a ghost town baby
where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that
when he tell the story that's not how it went

moved out the ritz and forgot 'bout the bent'
valet just called me to tell me come get it
knocked that boy off and i don't want no credit

i done seen a lot of shit i ain't never seen a a young nigga as consistent as you that has affected the world in such a positive way since you know michael jackson
and then when you've finally got the crib 
you did it like not even none of us did it you feel me uhm
nah i mean i did it like that i ain't gon' lie i ain't gon' lie to you
i did it like that but i ain't never been affected by another nigga crib in the way that did it to inspire me
how cats told me that he'd been inspired 
and felt that feelin' in they gut like i gotta work harder 
well i mean workin' harder just to compete bro for real for real

previously on ready to die
never had a lot this is all i need
people never care 'til it's rip
niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
loyalty is priceless and it's all i need
can't burn a bridge just to light my way
lotta 42 on the flights i'm takin'
pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
never had a lot this is all i need
people never care 'til it's rip
niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
never had a lot this is all i need
lost individuals is all i see
grab the top spot like pardon my reach
woke up one day and it was all on me
if it comes down it's gon' fall on me
lotta 42 on the flights i'm takin'
long way down from the heights i'm chasin'
just touched down i was lights out in vegas
girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
hard to tell people that i'm all out of favors
call me for songs or they call me for paper
turnin' off my phone for the night now baby
pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
some of my niggas don't love me
we should sit down before shit turns ugly
we should sit down since you said things about me
never had a lot this is all i need
people never care 'til it's rip
niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
loyalty is priceless and it's all i need
can't burn a bridge just to light my way
lotta 42 on the flights i'm takin'
pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
lotta fallin' outs help me build foundation
never had a lot this is all i need
people never care 'til it's rip
niggas turned they back on me for no good reason
you should slide through and get your back broke
used to be involved with me with no emotion
i was on the way to the next show
you was on the phone and you were so open
heard you said you're over me is that so
you don't ever filter girl and that's okay
coulda held on but you let it go
sayin' to yourself that it's better this way
funny thing is that you're going to need me and i know
you should slide through and get your back broke
funny thing is that you're going to need me and i know
you should slide through and get your back broke
feelings i've been stackin' like a bankroll
i should probably find a way to let it go
wonder what it was that turned you this cold
said you left me jaded and i wasn't joking
miss the way it was a couple years ago
back when we was young and now you've outgrown me
hard to just accept i was a steppin' stone
way that people talk about you i should've known
you're going to need me and i know
you should slide through and get your back broke
funny thing is that you're going to need me and i know
you should slide through and get your back broke
for my nigga hush
yeah look
dressed in fatigues i rep the east with my trustees
smokin' on crushed leaves
they turn they back on everything we built then they must bleed
i've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
straps over territory they know we must keep
get home and white air forces get brushed clean
back when my mama would interrupt sleep
to tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
summertime heatwaves i used to just cut sleeves
my shorty really love me man she want me to cut keys
i can't do that normal type of life is it just me
niggas steady try to ride the wave but it's rough seas
i'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
and the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
it's on meech like it's trendy
runnin' round from laurier to mackenzie when the city's empty yeah
early twenties but i want fifties hundreds not pennies
i need plenty
got me ready to flip the f out like fendi
whatever's in me it's takin' over
i gotta bust it down break it open
until somebody starts takin' notice then we rollin'
yeah then we rollin' then we rollin'
deep pockets on a nigga i can't find my phone in
now we rollin'
yeah then we rollin' then we rollin'
deep pockets on a nigga i can't find my phone in
now we rollin'
look
back when big apple sold dreams i stuck to my own thing
back when the house that i own now was my home screen
before i'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
runnin' missions
pyramid schemes just like the egyptians
back when hotlines were still flippin'
now i'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
transitions plans switchin' ambition
mindin' my business buildin' a business et cetera
inspired by a few but my mind really drives itself like tesla
i always had a little somethin' extra
back when corey was our sole investor
and the car could get from a to b but won't impress ya
look i ain't no baller
still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
my soundtrack is the second carter dreamin' of acceptin' offers
and easin' tensions
keepin' family out of east detention
and out of pine hill funeral center
spots we got no business enterin'
back when jill scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
i had to find a way to get someone's attention
then we rollin' then we rollin'
deep pockets on a nigga i can't find my phone in
now we rollin'
yeah then we rollin' then we rollin'
deep pockets on a nigga i can't find my phone in
now we rollin'
yeah
somebody um
somebody hit me today and they were like
nah just make sure you know
you tell me what to do when i get there you know
i said i respect it no problem
i got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
know what i'm sayin'
yeah my hand's always open for real
ayy
thirty three years i gave that to the game
thirty three mil' i'll save that for the rain
five hundred weeks i'll fill the charts with my pain
five hundred mil' and i'll fall back in the 6ix
finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
michael jackson shit but the palace is not for kids
still women sayin' it's childish the way we live
brought a few ws to the 6ix
baby mama fluke but i love her for who she is
baby wayne and tez responsible for this shit
half the time i question my consciousness in this shit
other times i question if compliments are legit
full time i'm out here confident as a bitch
tryna make good on the promises that i give
tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
register the business in my brother's name
thirty five hunnid in her pocket that should cover things
certified lover man trappin' out the motherland
always move right so my watch is on the other hand
she can try and play it down now but she was a fan
people wanna know what's in my pockets they don't understand
my assistant always findin' percocet and rubber bands
know my mom might not want to hear how i discover plans
word to sandra graham no one love you like your mother can
i watched michael rubin win a million off a couple hands
i decide what to see next like it's on demand
i decide what to be next like i'm switchin' plans
i'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
i will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 god prayin' hands like i'm a religious man
but i'm just a sicker man wicked man
look we can argue back and forth but who's the richer man
isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in
bang those dividends snakes stay slitherin'
how you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in
how you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in
how you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again
how you gettin' hype off one hit do that shit again
how you got a manager you mad at after you got the win
bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
give 'em a percentage see what happens to your blessings then
you just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
there when others should've been
got a nigga starin' at the game like damn coach put him in
but you never listen so you niggas goin' wood again
got us in the crib talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been shoulda been
and i got your girl on the second floor beggin' me to put it in
and it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
and it's not because i set it up to try and get revenge
it's because you niggas insecure you ain't made men
it's because even though you hate on me we stay friends
it's because you niggas never learn when to say when
yeah
for real
facts you know what i'm sayin'
hahaha yeah

lost you to the game i gotta hug that
i was here when you was asking where the love at
dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
i was wishin' on a star when i was that
i've been fortunate enough to have it my way
i'm a fortune teller listen to what i say
'member when we used to park up in my driveway
i always told it how it was i never shy away
this life is really something you get lost in
i know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
i had friends that only had half of they heart in
it's hard to accept now and it was hard then
but i treated you like gold i was all in
spoiled rotten they could smell you 'fore you walked in
burnin' incense in your new apartment
but you got no sense when it come to
lost you to the game i gotta hold that
how you feelin' in your soul since you sold that
i'll be better off without you and we know that
you ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
like i'm tryna show the waves this is no cap
you sold me up the river but i rowed back
you put me on the road without a roadmap
i'm not tryna make no song these are cold facts
you got some liquor at the house
yeah
go get a shot let's do a shot together
i don't see it

being here wasn't in the plans
i do it for the grahams not the 'gram
i do it for the fam but still fuckin' uncle sam
i tried to change for you but that wasn't who i am
even when being real is out of fashion
niggas keep stealin' my style now we out here matchin'
i did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
i couldn't sit around and wait i had to have it happen
lost you to the game i gotta face that
really think i lost you like a ways back
always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
i took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
you was supposed to grow some wings get your own pair
we started this from the bottom now you alone there
shit you treat it like it's home there
dependent on me you was supposed to get your own share
i still love you to my last days
i never knew that shit would be this fast paced
i never thought i'd see awards in a glass case
i could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
it could've went left on a couple bad days
when i visit my last place is the only time i'm in last place
see me these days i never got on a sad face
see me these days i
lost you to the game and i see why
it was always you and i without the t y
this is not one of them stories that got three sides
this is not one of them stories you could rewind
like i'm tryna show the waves this is no cap
you drove a nigga crazy but i drove back
you wrote me off and then you never wrote back
i'm not tryna make no song these are cold facts
yes sir
hold on hold on

'cause i got new girls i could use her opinion on
she thinks i've become a slave to the wealth
but i'd never break the promises i made to myself
and i would never make up names for myself
then change the names that i just gave to myself
certain rappers would call me to say what up though
i used to brag about it to my friends
and now i'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
and maybe that's all they do is just pretend
damn but i bought it though i believed it
yeah i thought it and i achieved it

and even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
i can't even capture the feeling i had at first
meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
the people i look up to are goin' from bad to worse
their actions out of character even when they rehearse
workin' in the land of the free the home of the brave
i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place
breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
and they don't like that it's written all on they face
i don't know how i'ma make it out of here clean

missin' out on my years
there's times when i wish i was where i was
back when i used to wish i was here
missin' out on my days
scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
i try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
most times it's just somebody that's underaged
that's probably just alone and afraid
and lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
i always hear people complain about the place that they live
that all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
that makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome
then she finally got to rome
and all she did was post pictures for people at home
'cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
i know another girl that's cryin' out for help
but her latest caption is leave me alone
i know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
i know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
to post later and make it look like she still on the go
look at the way we live
i wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
i was hidin' the world from my kid
from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
until you starin' at your seed you can never relate
breakin' news in my life i don't run to the blogs
the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call
they always ask why let the story run if it's false
you know a wise man once said nothin' at all
i'm exhausted and drained i can't even pretend

ten of us we movin' as one
i'm so proud of who i've become
you might think i've taken some lumps
only if we talkin' 'bout sums 
intentions are pure they cannot tell me relax
my mentions are jokes but they never give me the facts
this isn't that can't be ignorin' the stats
based off of that they gotta run me the max
they gotta run me the max they gotta double the racks
they had it set up for real but they didn't come with the slaps
when i heard the shit i was skippin' through that
if i get it trippin' it's no comin' back
i don't understand these niggas gotta adapt
you know where i'm at i put the 6 on the map
your shorty was bent she wanted to vent
i promise it fell in my lap
my money is young my problems are old
i promise i'm bridgin' the gap
woo you know what i'm sayin'

yeah you know what i'm sayin'
niggas provoke this shit ain't a joke man nobody playin'
he's at the top and he's at the top but nobody stayin'
these niggas around but they ain't around
you know what i'm sayin'
say that they down when they shit is down
you know what i'm sayin'
yeah you know what i'm sayin'
ayy ayy yeah
you know what i'm sayin'
yo get close enough to hov smell like a kilo still 
first album 26 i ain't need no deal 
already a hood legend i ain't need no shyne 
first rollie flooded out i ain't see no time woah
stand up niggas we only duckin' indictments
dope boys off white lookin' like soft white on 'em
heh you know what i'm sayin'
we in the buildin' we came for a billion ain't nobody playin'
live every word that i'm rappin'
say i lost 90 bricks and it happened
you probably wouldn't believe
everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
i ain't on the 'gram they record who i am
god to these dope boys how do you not be a hov fan
i'm what meech shoulda been
i'm what supreme didn't become
if alpo didn't snitch niggas'd be like young
i got your president tweetin' i won't even meet with him

you know what i'm sayin'
ayy ayy yeah
you know what i'm sayin'
niggas provoke this shit ain't a joke man nobody playin'
he's at the top and he's at the top but nobody stayin'
these niggas around but they ain't around
you know what i'm sayin'
say that they down when they shit is down
you know what i'm sayin'
yeah you know what i'm sayin'
ayy ayy yeah
you know what i'm sayin'
only holdin' up i do is my end of the bargain
only beggin' that i do is me beggin' your pardon
only tryin' that i do is me tryin' the hardest
only problems i do are math problems with profit
only lyin' i do is lyin' out in the tropics
only cryin' i do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
only lackin' i can do is my lack of responses
only rest that i do is where the rest of my commas
still i rise maya angelou vibes
when life comin' at you from all angles and sides
and they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
it really boils down to how you plan to survive
love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
give 'em nice things but what's that to 'em
especially when another girl i flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
and they recognize the bathroom
all hell starts to break loose in my texts
i only tell lies to who i gotta protect
i would rather have you remember me how we met
i would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
but that'll never happen the way i'm watchin' my step
that ain't what i'm 'bout
i'm in control of my destiny never in doubt
if i can't make it with you i'll make it without
they say take the good with the bad i'll take it without
houston women i wine and dine and take to the house
my moral compass is janky it breaks in the south
is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts
is there more to life than sayin' i figured it out
is there more yeah
sweeter the berry the blacker the juice
the boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth
too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
too many walt disney characters mouses and goofs
i mean you know i love a challenge but challenged by who
i'll let you bring a thousand recruits
my peers are a talented group
but even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
there's still nothin' they could really do
it's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
whenever it's time to recoup
yeah soon as this album drop i'm out of the deal
in the house playin' d'angelo how does it feel
i got a fear of havin' things on my mind when i die
what you got time on your hands or time on your side
is there any sense in doin' these songs when i'm high
is there more to life than goin' on trips to dubai
yachts on the 4th of july g5 soarin' the skies
is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
and all of these fortunate times
and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size
am i missin' somethin' that's more important to find
like healin' my soul like family time
is there more to life than just when i'm feelin' alive
is there more
passion instant
sweat beads feel me 
cupid's shot me
my heartbeat's racing 
tempt me drive me 
it feels so exciting
thought of highly 
it's yours entirely

girl that could never be me

my competition it's beyond offensive

not tryna be fourth and inches i'm tryna go the distance
yeah distance i'm on a different mission
this the remix to ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
how you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches
too overly ambitious too late to fix it
too late for condolences when it's over with
i need to start sayin' shit when i notice it
be open with people i need some closure with
be honest with myself and take ownership
opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
i really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
excitin' times revitalized
trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
i'm just takin' what god will give me
grateful like jerry bob and mickey
better attitude we'll see where it gets me
i know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
i wrote the book on world class finesses
and tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
and never placin' second
and even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
inspirin' and never takin' credit
i know i deserve more i just never said it
two middle fingers as i make a exit yeah
did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you
winnin' is problematic
people like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
not when you have it
way less support from my peers
in recent years as i get established
unforgivin' times but fuck it i manage
why is my struggle different than others'
only child thats takin' care of his mother
as health worsens and bills double
thats not respectable all of a sudden
i dont get a pat on the back for the come up
what do you see when you see me
when did all the things i mean
from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
maybe i share it with too many people
back then it used to just feel like our secret
back when i would write and not think about how they receive it
i be tryna manifest the things i needed
and look now i mean it's hard to believe it even for me
but you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
how they go from not wantin' me at all
to wantin' to see me lose it all
things get dark but my aura just starts glowin'
i'm overcome with emotions
ones i can't access when i'm stoned sober
jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
i could only speak what i know of
man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
and icy heineken drinkin' and rival neighborhoods linkin'
and puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
all you did was write the book on garbage ass rollies
ego strokin' picture postin'
claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
but you just had to show me
see i know 'cause i study you closely
i know when someone lyin'
i notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
i know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
sometimes i gotta just make sure that i didn't lose you
did i did i
did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you

you know hun i'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that i'm hearing in your voice these days i can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust but that attitude will just hold you back in this life and you're going to continue to feel alienated give some thought to this because im confident in you and i know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation i'm hearing in your tone these days when others go low we go high

silence keeps cloudin' me
hand on my heart
and i i wish time never mattered
yeah stylin though
dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
all the things you need you still want problems though
all the things i know i still been silent though
yeah used to be at silvercity indigo
used to be in lunchroom playin dominoes
i don't want to have to go to funerals
i gotta start sleepin' at the studio
i don't have no time to be no romeo
all the love i need is at the rodeo
all the love i need is here at ovo yeah
all the girls i know are there with e and tho
who knows where i end up when that shit gets old
maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
last table left in carbone callin' plays on the rotary phone
i take a glass of domina to go with me home
might move our annual shit to the 'dome
i need 40000 people to see what i'm on
yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry yute when i was writin views
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
ill probably self destruct if i ever lose but i never do
steady doin' double shifts
1da doin the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because i'm generous
thirty seater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assured that my mind is right
get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days
never stick around to see shit change
get lil' updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
seasons go by like i'm binge watchin'
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
i can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
distractions will do you in in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me
and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me whatever splits it up
so there's more for them and there's less for me
they don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no one's done it successfully
7am in germany can't believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
that's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart it's always executed perfectly
if we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity you one day star
swear i told you that i'm in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors a lot of 6 god worshipping
done talk now 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
there's real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog but his grandmother's his surety
he can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is centered 'round competition and currency
takin' summer off 'cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
i'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
more life
more life
more time with family and friends more life
i've still got vibrations to send more life
they say that we could live forever
at night i pray it's true
i've done so much in my short time and still there's more to do
but if someone should come collecting
sooner than we're all expecting
at least the life you lived was one for you
 drake
it's a little chilly out there
how you can stand there is beyond me
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need family for
cause i can't depend on you anymore
always saw you for what you could've been
ever since you met me
like when chrysler made that one car
that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you could've been
and even when it's business with you it's personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet
and now we're meeting our end
and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time 
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
you're so predictable i hate people like you
kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
how you supposed to figure out what i'm going through
you can't even figure out what's going on with you
you judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
i make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
out here in la i don't know what's going on
i don't know what's going on
and it's all because you chose a side
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasn't time 
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
you sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
my luck is a sure thing cause i'm living right
when i needed you you couldn't give me any advice
but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
i'm fooding and serving them all
like i'm working for minimum wage
someone up there must just love testing my patience
someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
forgiveness for your ways
if i ever loved ya i'll always love ya that's how i was raised
same way i'm right here still feeling the way
same way i'm realizing on a day to day that
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my let's just be friends are friends i don't have anymore
guess that's what they say you need your family for
cause i can't depend on you anymore
much closer
any time people want to start problems
it's like for real are you dumb
you know who mans are
i'm not afraid no gyal heart man
and i'm not afraid of no cyattie
and i'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
so anybody who want it can get it
seh feh
yeah for the dogs dem you know
man when shit gets like this man the whole city
shit's crazy right now and shit ain't gonna stop
know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better
look momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
better than her telling me the check's no good
now they wanna act like i do no good
funny 'cause i really did more than i should
i made a decision last night that i would die for it
just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
you know 40 wants peace but i'm down to cut ties for it
and i can't sleep these days unless i take one
if they don't have a story these days they'll make one
life is always on man i never get a break from it
doesn't matter where i go i can never get away from it
they give me loyalty and i don't gotta pay for it
same way breads gotta break for it
keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
and i turn the six upside down it's a nine now
i made a decision last night that i would die for it
all these hand outs man it's getting outta hand
i'ma start telling niggas get it how you can
i got it right now so i'm everybody's friend
if i ever lose i bet we never speak again
i made a decision last night i'd die for it
just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
first place first place man we can't be tied for it
i only drove it five times paid 15 for it
keychain go jang a lang i wanna do major things
mj in every way i just don't fade away
six upside down it's a nine now
like mannie like stunna man shit is big time now
and i made a decision last night that i would die for it
make me feel the same way that i did to you
trust me when i say i thought it all through
trust me when i say that shit is old moves
god made himself a way from me to you
tried to kill me but they still want the views
tried to kill me but they still want the views
tried to kill me but i am very much alive on the six side

and i think we just get closer when we not together
you tell me that i'm confusin'
more immature than marques houston

we too deep in this thing you'll never lose me
lolol i'm glad you find this shit amusin'
heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
i know you heard that my pool parties like mardi gras
i know you heard that my girl is sponsored by audemars
that's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
and my house is the definition
of alcohol and weed addiction
you got a different vision
you wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
without runnin' into one of my niggas
that's not the way we livin'
too much goin' on it's just not realistic
these days i don't talk 'bout them days like i miss 'em

then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
he let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
feel like i never say much but man there's a lot to know

i'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
i mean you boys not even coming close
i gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
you number one and i'm eddie murphy we tradin' places
look in the mirror i'm closer than i really appear
creepin' like chilli without the tender love and care
no tender love and care no love and affection
i got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
i might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
yeah but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
a lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
your best day is my worst day i get green like earth day
you treat me like i'm born yesterday you forgot my birthday
you don't be scorin' perfect
you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
you platinum like wrappers
on hershey's boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was urgent
and then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and did it with a purpose
used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships

yeah you feel the pressure man i know the pressure
and my wifey is a spice like i'm david beckham
a lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
ovo on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress up
and i know who gon' take the fall with me
they right here on call with me they all with me
you could throw curve balls but i got the glove fitted
they've been sayin' it's love but it isn't love is it
toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
i worked at jaydees connections whenever jason let me
ceesays i was buyin' fitteds everyday
kiddie's caribana tryin' not to catch a stray
i dropped out right before i graduate
six credits left my mama had her saddest day
it's only up from here i promise you just gotta wait
and she took my word for it that's all i had to say
lately i just feel so out of character
the paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
i get a blank page when i try to draw a comparison
i'm gettin' straight to the point with it
need y'all to know that i never needed none of y'all niggas
fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
it's like the front of the plane nigga it's all business
but i haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
look they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
my niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
who you think runnin' this show
you saw it in me at 20 years old
the lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
i got a pure soul i don't do the hate
you don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
me and niko used to plot on how to make a change
now me and kobe doin' shots the night before the game
still drop 40 with liquor in my system
numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
i might see you on and off but i'll never switch ya
niggas quick to double cross like both of us christian
lamborghini got me feelin' like i'm christian bale
and i never bend my morals for the ticket sales
tippin' scales bars heavy like triple xl
i never tag no one in i'd rather get you myself
runnin' through the 6 thumbin' through the contracts
i'm possessed you can see it under the contacts
they think i had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
i still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
payment plan for the family debt we in the minus
and like it's goin' in a trunk i put it all behind us
where you tryna go i got it i'll take us wherever
i'm a staple in the game all my papers together
and my life is on display like truman
they wanna pree the movements gotta start to make 'em sooner
my exes made some of my favorite music
i dated women from my favorite movies
karma's such a thing of beauty
i'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
it's farfetched like i threw that shit a hundred meters
i keep it a hundred like i'm running a fever

oh you gotta love it oh you gotoh you gotta love it
i heard what circulated let's get to the bottom of it
i told 1da send me something and i got it covered
somehow i always rise above it
why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover
the game is all mine and i'm mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better successor
every shot you see 'em take at me they all contested
allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep wanting more
tryna decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight wonder what's next for me
longevity wonder how long they'll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but can't change it alone
i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe
that's quite a platform you chose you should've kept it inside
oh you tried it's so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your girl's age
it gets worse by the annual
my career's like a how to manual so i guess it's understandable man
oh you gotta love it you gotta love it yeah
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
to show they outfits off guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin'
i'm managed by my friends that i grew up with
i'd rather give that 15 to people i fuck with
if me and future hadn't made it with this rappin'
we'd prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on
but here we are yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my messages like we had words
and stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
bitter women i'm overtextin' are pmsing
crazy this yearfuckin' with my image
i've been tryna reach the youth so i can save 'em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait 'til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
nobody lookin' out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein' somebody that makes the news so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
damn i just had to say my piece about it
oh you gotta love it
but they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public that's a hotter subject
i been whippin' mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins
shout out to ashley tasha bianca
julia ericka southern america
part of my heritage pardon my arrogance
part in my hair again that's that comeback flow
comeback flow once i start it's apparent
i'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
but fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
your content so aggressive lately what's irkin' you
shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
i wanna prove that i'm number one over all these niggas
bein' number two is just being the first to lose
my city dictated music nobody seein' us
winter here already but somehow i'm heatin' up
been observin' the game and felt like i've seen enough
let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see wassup
yeah boy you rappin' like you seen it all
you rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
best i ever had seems like a decade ago
decadent flow and i still got a decade to go
oh please take it ease where's the love and the peace
why you rappin' like you come from the streets
i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
and i'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
special order for anybody that's comin' for me
shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
you see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40 oli and me
cuttin' all loose ends i be the barber for free
i'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
feel like i'm in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats
man oh you gotta love it yeah
and on top of that it's getting harder to eat
rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease
to think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
and now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
but man oh you gotta love it 
yeah
and head to toe i'm prada covered 
i know your girl well just not in public
blame the city i'm a product of it
young nigga from the city

but that's still the boss don't get sent for
get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
hot temper scary outcome
here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
that always let they mouth run
bench players talkin' like starters i hate it
started from the bottom now we here nigga we made it
yeah tom ford tuscan leather smellin' like a brick
degenerates but even ellen love our shit
rich enough that i don't have to tell 'em that i'm rich
self explanatory you just here to spread the story wassup
sittin' gucci row like they say up at unlv
young rebel young money nothin' you could tell me
paperwork takin' too long maybe they don't understand me
i'll compromise if i have to i gotta stay with the family
not even talkin' to nicki communication is breakin'
i dropped the ball on some personal shit i need to embrace it
i'm honest i make mistakes i'd be the second to admit it
think that's why i need her in my life to check me when i'm trippin'
on a mission tryna shift the culture
tell me who dissin' i got some things that'll hit the culprit
them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin'
all of the talkin' got one reply for all of your comments
fuck what you think i'm too busy that's why you leave a message
born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive
that shit i heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
like ayy b i got your cd you get an e for effort
i piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
owl chains like credentials you know you see the necklace
my life's a completed checklist
i'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
just give it time we'll see who's still around a decade from now
that's real
how much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro
lately i've been feelin' like guy pearce in memento
i just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo
the family all that matters i'm just out here with my kinfolk
off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
this for shorty up on glengrove who love when i catch my tempo
i sip the pora and listen to cappadonna 
the fresh prince just had dinner with tatyana no lie
all these 90's fantasies on my mind
the difference is that with mine they all come true in due time
i might come through without security to check if you're fine
that's just me on my solo like fuck it like yolo
wanted to tell you accept yourself
you don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
and if you end up needin' some extra help then i could help
you know back on your feet and shit
tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit
how much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro
how this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though
life is soundin' crazy 40 on martin scorsese
and i wouldn't change a thing if you paid me now real nigga wassup
how much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro
if there's hell below i'll see you when you get there are you enjoyin' yourselves if we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears shedding similar tears and of course dying in so many years it don't mean that we can't have a good life so we'd like to just maybe close out with something some food for thought for all of us
somewhere between psychotic and iconic
somewhere between i want it and i got it
somewhere between i'm sober and i'm lifted
somewhere between a mistress and commitment
but i stay down girl i always stay down get down never lay down
promise to break everybody off before i break down
everyone just wait now so much on my plate now
people i believed in they don't even show they face now
what they got to say now nothin' they can say now
nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
what more can i say now what more can i say now
you might feel like nothin' was the same

and now you hate me stop pretendin' stop that frontin' i can't take it
girl don't treat me like a stranger girl you know i seen you naked

with them bitches i don't get it you're a star love
you shouldn't have to deal with that
i'd never make you feel like that 'cause
i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you
you give but you cannot take love
yeah i needed to hear that shit i hate when you're submissive
passive aggressive when we're texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
started realizing a couple places i could take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation that's lacking in patience
i've been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
we've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that nigga's amazing
well fuck it we had a couple coronas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child i'm in your zone
looking like you came from the 70's on your own
my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone
you don't even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something i'm missing and disappear when i'm bored
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh
i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you
you give but you cannot take love
uh thinking 'bout texas back when porscha used to work at treasures
or further back than that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my momma's debit
a weak attempt at flexing i'll never forget it
'cause that night i played her three songs
then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
then she start telling me how i'll never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now it's therapeutic blowing money in the galleria
or beverly center macy's where i discovered bria
landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree
i've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married what's the rush on commitment
know we were going through some shit name a couple that isn't
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl i felt like we had it all planned out i guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how i'm living i just hope i'm forgiven
it seem like you don't want this love anymore
i'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh
i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you
you give but you cannot take love

rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you

about family and struggle and it takin' forever

lookin' in the mirror i'm embarrassed
i'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
react like an infant whenever you are mentioned
mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
i'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands i was dealt
when i said the music business was all i needed
when i got it i was greeted by an alien
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction that'd keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend
my vice is similar women love when you're my type
and you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel sin city
devil in a dress platinum chanel live the ambiance all
'cause the audience one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse bein' read
i'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music

and your weave look good with the indian tracks
trackin' device on your used 5 series

sat down with a few drinks located where you can't see us
a white waitress on standby when we need her
a black maybach 40 pulled up jeep
no doors all that nigga was missin' was aaliyah
felt like the initiation a reality livin' in the matrix
we talk casually about the industry
and how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
then he said that he was the same age as myself
and it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo
the reason why i'm breathin' all the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why the highlight was when he said
you belong to the people when you're outside
so dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy
full of fame and bury yourself alive then i died
yeah
bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water
rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape

it's your worst nightmare it's my first night here
and this girl right here who knows what she knows
so i'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there i don't trust these hoes at all
but that's just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple pornstars that i'm ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna my only role models
haffa and jordan my only role models
that's why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
bottom sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
all of the little accents that make me a king
i never hear the disses they try and point out to me
but it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
i'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout christmas in august
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some shake a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs fields they're making the cookie stretch
i know it so well i know the hustle so well
stunt like i'm working overnighters right by the motel

mixtape legend underground kings
lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things 
with my new bitch that's living in palm springs
young ass nigga lifelong dreams
they take the greats from the past and compare us
i wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
in a time where it's recreation
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be poking fun at
never the flow though they know i run that
fuck you all i claim that whenever
i changed rap forever the game back together yeah

i'm hearing all of the jokes i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin' emotion don't ever mean i'm a pussy

so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows lord knows i'm heavy i got my weight up

we live in a generation of not being in love
and not being together
but we sure make it feel like we're together
because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
so cry if you need to but i can't stay to watch you
that's the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to but i can't stay to hold you
that's the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to but i can't stay to hear you
that's the wrong thing to do
cause you'll say you love me and i'll end up lying
and say i love you too
but i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it
oh ho you know it we both know it
i need someone different
you know it oh ho you know it

you got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
you must of done this before this can't be your first time 
'cause to her i'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
so if tonight's an accident tomorrow we'll recover
and i know i'm not supposed to judge a book by it's cover
i don't wanna be in the blind but sometimes i stevie wonder
about her and she with it
if i'm with it and i'm with it
i know what makes her smile but i wan' know what makes her different
or should i just be realistic lipstick on the glass
i know this ain't your first but it's better than your last tunechi
you must of done this before this can't be your first time
we must of been here before it's still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
you must of done this before this can't be your first time 
shower her with dollar tips shawty went and bought a whip
guarantee the city remember your whole name
you throw the ho a scholarship all of them ain't all equipped
and this saddens me i see the pecking order
quote on quote bad bitches work the whole floor
those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
like a lab rat nobody want her
niggas that are married don't wanna go home
but we look up to them they wish they were us
they want some new trim we lust for some trust
now the both of us are colorblind
'cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in the boise state
can't see her play or the team cuz
everybody has an addiction mine happens to be you
and those who say they don't
souls will later on say to them that ain't true
all of them will have an opinion
but y'all know what y'all can do with them
but if you unsure i'll take you on tour
to a place you can stick that in
well sitting here sad as hell
listening to adele i feel you baby
someone like you more like someone unlike you
or something that's familiar maybe
and i can tell that she wants a baby
and i can yell girl that you're crazy
oh what the hell nope can't be lazy
please be careful bitches got the rabies
its like 09 in your basement
and im in love with nebby
and i still love her but it fell through because i wasnt ready
and your back hurt and your neck hurt
and you smoking heavy
and i sit next to you and i lecture you
because those are deadly
and then you ash it and we argue
about spending money on bullshit
and you tell me im just like my father
my one button you push it
now it's fuck you i hate you i'll move out in a heartbeat
and i leave out and you call me you tell me that you sorry
you love me and i love you
and your heart hurts mine does too
and it's just words and they cut deep
but it's our world it's just us two
i see painkillers on the kitchen counter
i hate to see it all hurt so bad
but maybe i wouldn't have worked this hard
if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
uh maybe i should walk up the street
and try and get a job at the bank
cause leave it up to me j and neeks
we'll probably end up robbing the bank
then wayne calls up my phone
conversation wasn't that long

money just changed everything
i wonder how life without it would go
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
looking down from the top and it's crowded below
my fifteen minutes started an hour ago
truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit
when i hear 'em talking i just don't know what to make of it
hate is so familiar to me i'm slowly embracing it
doesn't come natural bear with me it could take a bit
yeah and my dreams are who i'm racing with
but you can see i'm pacing it so that i'm always chasing it
wayne put me right here that's who i get the paper with
i hope that my success never alters our relationship
yeah this life is something i would die for
october's own but it's looking like july 4
i just wish they'd let you try it first
this time i'm really going off fireworks
oh today it begins
i've missed them before
but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night it's fireworks
every night it's fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off likeoh
i'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
look at how i'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
i could tell it wasn't love i just thought you'd fuck with me
who could've predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
damn i kept my wits about me luckily
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip rags want to cover me
and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
but i was curious
and i'll never forget it baby what an experience
you could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
there was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
that felt good all in all i learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah i should've looked up in the sky at first
now i can see it in her eyes fireworks
oh today it begins
i've missed them before
but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night it's fireworks
every night it's fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off likeoh
everything's the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen
and he's still got his foot out guilt tripping
it's been years though i just learn to deal with it
for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city i let her explore
and now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
how many of our parents marriages lasted
i was only 5 i bet i barely reacted
i'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
i want to witness love i never seen it close
yeah but i guess i gotta find it first
that's why i'm really going off fireworks
oh today it begins
i've missed them before
but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night it's fireworks
every night it's fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off likeoh
things have been so crazy and hectic
i shoulda gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
it's probably better anyhow
so if you gotta go
if there's anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if you're looking for a purpose
you put the tea in the kettle and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was joking
now i'm off singing karaoke
further than i've ever been
so if you gotta go
if there's any way i can help
isn't it ironic that the girl i want to marry is a wedding planner
that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta
damn of all the places you could go
i just thought you'd choose somewhere
that had somebody that you know
i'm always up too late i worry 'bout you there alone
in that place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
i hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
don't be fooled by the money i'm still just young and unlucky
i'm surprised you couldn't tell
i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and you're looking for a purpose
i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited you woulda liked it
i i  i know you all too well
i said that we could kiss the past goodbye
but you weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay but shawty here i go
should i spend a weekend in vegas
i'm living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it
i mean how could i forget my memory's never faded
i can't relate to these haters my enemies never made it
i am still here with who i started with
the game needed life i put my heart in it
i blew myself up i'm on some martyr shit
carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
i'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too i just planted a hundred seeds
it's ironic cause my mother was a florist
and that's how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous
it's happening penny lane just like you said
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
uh huh that's word to the millions that they putting up
i'm trying to do better than good enough
what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i don't have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised me you would never change
you promised me you would never change
am i wrong for making light of my situation clap on
when 40 got some shit for me to snap on now that i'm on
i don't really want to worry about getting back on
i'm just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on
i heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and i be acting like i don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that i just called
some chick i met at the mall that i barely know at all and
plus this woman that i messed with unprotected
texted saying she wished she would have kept it
the one that i'm laying next to just looked over and read it
man i couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
i'm holding on by a thread
it's like i'm high right now the guy right now
and you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we just having the time of our lives right now
what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i don't have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised me you would never change
you promised me you would never change
i live by some advice this girl lissa told me
the other day lissa told me that she missed the old me
which made me question when i went missing
and when i started treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast paced switch up
or the two guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause a girl i thought i trusted
was who set the whole shit up
but in fact i haven't seen them since they locked big rich up
i know but same time i'm quick to forget
i'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it all burn it all i'm starting it fresh
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed
did i just trade free time for camera time
will i blow all of this money baby hammer time
yeah i just need some closure
ain't no turning back for me i'm in it 'til it's over
uh uh
young money
yeah yeah yeah
i know way too many people here right now

and i'm ready for that i'm just saying
but i really can't complain everything is kosher

you could thank me now go 'head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay you could thank me now
mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately i've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
alohas to women with no ties to men
that i know well that way there are no lies
you can thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
i'm on the brink of influential i'm here for you niggas
i guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
i must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas
it's december 31st and we in miami just meditating
you got your resolutions we just got reservations
living out a dream it feels like i stayed up
and we just want to party patron straight up
fuck that old shit i'm on new things
ovo clique red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
who would have thought the route we'd chosen
would ever end up this scenic
i can relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
and that's around the time
that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike
but got to ai him for your survival
damn i swear sports and music are so synonymous
cause we want to be them and they want to be us
so on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
that you take for granted you can thank me now
and oh my goodness you're welcome you're welcome
at this point me is who i am trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them
get back to where they fell from
but drink up cause everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that i came with they good for life
that's how you know it's going down
in case another chance never comes around
you could thank me now go 'head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay you could thank me now
shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think i'm spending all my time with the wrong women
i think i'll have a chance at love and knowing me i'll miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones i used to hit are friends now
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion
over double pump lattes and low fat muffins
do i or is missing what we had out of the question
i'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroes
who was there before it all i guess that's how it goes
they hear about your cons but focus on your pros
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow into women
that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allowed where are they all now
i know they're somewhere watching
so i'm trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning you'll find it next to me
they tell me i'm the hottest guess we finally get to see
i'm feeling like nas who am i to disagree
they say the doors will open up
soon as you find the missing key
that's probably why i'm in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagon's full
but you can try and run behind it i'm sorry
poolside drinking margarita rounds
shout out to my city though i hardly be in town
i'm the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game
in which the cards are facing down
i'm in a world where things are taken never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and i'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while i'm still here in this position
you could thank me now go 'head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay you could thank me now
these are my one st thomas flows
me my niggas and some madonna hoes
that look just like virgins but trust they down to go
discussing life and all our common goals
smart kids that smoke weed honor roll
look how the champagne diamonds glow
fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
i'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
whatever it is i got it's clearly appealing
these other rappers getting that inferior feeling
i hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healing
take a look at yourself the mirror's revealing
if you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
people ask how music is going i heard it pays
i just came off making two million in 30 days
damn i guess it does is what the message was
sometimes i feel i be spending my money just because
with weezy i'm just out here repping us
'til i get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
yeah i know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
i ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
until i lose for now i'm the game's single leader
i fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
and book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
who you like tell me who it is
i'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
i should call it a night but fuck it i can't resist
this one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
without a response from me you really fail to exist
and i love to see you fail that feeling there is the shit
i swear pussy nigga get your bread up
enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
why your scary ass looking down pick ya head up
no one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get up
with nose plugs in now i can smell the set up
so you just wasting your time you only making me better yeah
i try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
chase n cash that's my brother from the surf club
damn that nigga always kept it so hood
back when we would smoke good at the oakwoods
and have girls fall through like coins in the couch
now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
scared for the first time everything just clicked
what if i don't really do the numbers they predict
considering the fact that i'm the one that they just picked
to write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
but if i really do it don't expect to get a split
cause this truly is some shit i don't expect for y'all to get
i'm nervous but i'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
throwing up in the huddle nigga willie beamen
but still throwing touchdown passes
in tortoise frame glasses hopin' that someone catch it
people say that old drake we startin' to miss it
but they need to be a little more specific
is this what y'all want in my best chris tucker impression
ducking your questions fuck your suggestions
money gets all of my love and affection
cars all black like the cover of essence

i'm goin' in i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard
bitch i'm goin' in i'm goin' in
i'm goin' in i'm goin' in
and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard
and i'ma go hard and i'ma go hard
uh
i'm just so far gone
october's own
please leave me alone
drunk off champagne
screamin' in the phone
see my house is not a home
fuck is going on
where did we go wrong
where do we belong
caught up in the game and it's one i can't postpone
meanin' if it rains i'm the one it's rainin' on
when my diamond chain is on still nothin' set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me don't forget 'em and i promise that i won't
feelin' so distant from everyone i've known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown parties that we've thrown
i've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
it's only been three years
look at how i've grown
i'm just in my zone
i call this shit the calm
yeah but i'm the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom and i swear my word is bond
everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
i'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
i know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't 'cause
you know everything gon' be all right i promise
i apologize to you know put y'all in this position vent to y'all but
40 mama always say dont ask permission
just ask forgiveness you know so uh forgive me yeah yeah
say
uh
and life is so insane
look what i became trying to make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
it's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention therefore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
tryin' to enjoy myself with tez in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
it's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
so i'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
hoping western union doing currency exchange
'cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
like how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn and i can only feel his pain
'cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
so i'm filling out the form at the counter once again
he say he love me i just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
i'm why your girl heart is in a sling
call me heartbreak drake i'm the hardest one to tame
as a man i'm just honest as an artist i'm a king
with my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
yeah and see this is the thang
what they viewing as bragging is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the single handed reason i remain me yeah
uh
i said i call this shit the calm
but im the furthest thing from calm
swear im putting on
but they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on like
man
this is why i do this shit
i think they call this venting
look this is me still the same
they want the hits i play the game
no auto tune but you can feel the pain
it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein
what up lil bro what up slum ville
i hope you know that y'all the reason i have fun still
the fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
equal opportunity rapping that shit is unreal
that ain't how it works that ain't how it goes
and i been getting high just to balance out the lows
and i could use a writer just to balance out my flows
but i never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows
and every time i try it opens up my eyes
these verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
and i would be performing this as long as i'm alive
so every word i utter will be mine
don't believe the lies look me in my eyes
please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me
i remember you this feeling isn't new
so please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me
i never cried when pac died
but i probably will when hov does
and if my tears hold value then i would drop one
for every single thing he showed us
and i'll be standing in a puddle
i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
and i'ma keep it honest i'm so tired of being subtle
it's just me 40 o and nik standing in a huddle
staring at the members of my team
who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
i hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
but y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless
and know i pop bottles 'cause i bottle my emotions
at least i put it all in the open
don't believe the lies look me in my eyes
please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me
i remember you this feeling isn't new
so please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me
look fuck all y'all we ignore feelings here
premature millionaires welcome to my realest year
yeah i swear that we making a killing here
i should be on top of the world just chilling here
but it's funny having fans
who find you before anybody ever has the chance
and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
and realize when you're there sometimes the shit don't feel the same
yeah and plus things are just surreal at home
people think i've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
and now security follow me everywhere
so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone
i think i'm scared of what the future holds
i was wishing for some things and now am used to those
every girl i meet thinks i'm fucking groupie hoes
the honesty of my music has left me too exposed
all my old friends think i got a new crowd
and people seem to notice every time i do smile
i guess that mean they come few and far between
even though i'm living out what you would call the dream
and my uncle ain't even messaging me
and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
i hope this isn't one of those forever things
it's funny how money can change everything
don't believe the lies look me in my eyes
please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me
i remember you this feeling isn't new
so please don't be scared of me please don't be scared of me
i'm tryna do it all tonight i got plans
i got a certain lust for life and as it stands
everything is going as right as it can
they tryna shoot down my flight before it lands before it lands
but you could miss me with all that
diss me then crawl back
i really wish y'all would fall back
but gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
and these days women make offers
and who the hell am i to say 
my ex sendin' late night texts
'cause she don't know how to let 
uh she in love
and as for them pretty light skinned models
standin' in the cold ah yeah they with us
let them girls in for a drink and i'm all in they ear
sayin' she should be the one i see every time that i'm here
but when am i really even here
black suburban with the tint on it
fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
the game got these old handprints on it
but i'mma be the one to pour cement on it
uh and start over
and show up in a margiela tux i don't really give a fuck
and we only gettin' older
so what i tend to do is to think of today as the past
it's funny when you comin' in first but you hope that you last
you just hope that it last

yeah
spending every moment in the studio
i never said it'd be fair
but when you're all alone i hope you truly know
how bad i want to be there
come right in set your bag down
took a night off for you
go ahead and turn the lights off
but keep your heels on
they're fittin' for what i'm about to do oh
know you hate explaining how you want it done
just be quiet i'll do fine without your help girl
can you work without a second for some fun
now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
and i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i been waiting for so long to get you all alone
now i finally got you right here
so baby i'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'cause i wanna make one thing clear
i want you on top so let your hair down
i took the night off for you
girl i'm gonna turn the lights off but keep your heels on
they're fittin' for what we're about to do
come right in set your bag down
i took a night off for you
go ahead and turn the lights off
but keep your heels on
they're fittin' for what i'm about to do oh
know you hate explaining how you want it done
just be quiet i'll do fine without your help girl
can you work without a second for some fun
now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
and i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
oh it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio
why do i feel so alone
like everybody passing through the studio
is in character as if he acting out a movie role
talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
and i don't have the heart
to give these bitch niggas the cue to go
so they stick around kicking out feedback
and i entertain it as if i need that
i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
my privacy about the only thing i need back but
it's hard to think of them polite flows
when stefano pilati suits are your night clothes
and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
and you still make it even when they say your flight closed
eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
life was so full now this shit just being lipo'd
always said i'd say it all on the right track
but in this game you only lose when you fight back
black diamond bracelets showing you the basics
i can't live and hold the camera someone gotta tape this
and make hits like a bitch that's married i ain't miss
24 hours from greatness i'm that close
don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
transitioning from fitting in to standing out
los angeles cabanas or atlanta south
watchin' hov's show embarrassed to pull my camera out
and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out
so i park about five houses down
she say i shouldn't have it until i have the crown
but i don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
so she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus
but yet i'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'cause what i'm working with is timeless
and promoters try to get me out to they club
and say i have fun but i can't imagine how
'cause i just seen my ex girl standing with my next girl
standing with the girl that i'm fuckin' right now
and shit could get weird unless they all down
and so i stay clear we from a small town
and everybody talks and everybody listen
and somehow the truth just always comes up missing
i've always been something that these labels can't buy
especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
and sylvia be tellin' tez damn drake fly
and he just be like silly motherfucker i know
that was your bad how could you pass up on 'em
he just take them records and he gas up on 'em
wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em
oh they did po at least they tried to
and that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
and they think they can market you however they decide to
nah but 40 told me to do me
and don't listen to anybody that knew me
'cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
and if you think i changed in the slightest coulda fooled me
boy and to my city i'm the 2 3
drug dealers live vicariously through me
i quit school and it's not because i'm lazy
i'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
understand i could get money with my eyes closed
lost some of my hottest verses down in cabo
so if you find a blackberry with the side scroll
sell that mothafucka to any rapper that i know
'cause they need it much more than i ever will
i got new shit i'm gettin' better still
little niggas put my name in they verses
'cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
future said 'cause this 'ye shit you better kill
and i think this got this making of a legend feel
problem with these other niggas they ain't never real
yeah that's all i can say
hands down i'm too proud for love
but with eyes shut it's you i'm thinkin' of
but how we move from a to b it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know who i was before you
and basically to see a change in me
i'd be losing so i just ignore you yeah
oh but you're on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind
oh but maybe in time in time in time i'll tell you i'm
a little bit a little bit
a little bit in love with you
i guess that i'm a little bit a little bit
a little bit in love with you
i know you told me break their hearts
but it's you i wanna take apart
and i will never ever be the first to say it
but still i they know i
i would do it push a button
pull a trigger climb a mountain
jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
i love you love you a little bit
i would do it you would say it
you would mean it we could do it
it was you and i and only i mmm
i think i'm a little bit little bit
a little bit in love with you
but only if you're a little bit
little bit in love with me
i hope they never find out
what they already know know know
as soon as it's official
we'll have to let it go go go
so we don't confirm the fling
keep avoiding all the questions
you could teach me many things
i'm just scared to learn a lesson
the pressure's on both hearts beat like a metronome
both in sync like a justin song
feels so right but it's just so wrong
i wonder where my world 'bout
when niggas that i know tryna take my girl out
and her friends say i ain't the one to go for
she just jealous cause you always get approached more
oh well tell her fall back

drunk off champagne
screamin' in the phone
see my house is not a home
fuck is going on
where did we go wrong
where do we belong
caught up in the game and it's one i can't postpone
meanin' if it rains i'm the one it's rainin' on
when my diamond chain is on still nothin' set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me don't forget 'em and i promise that i won't
feelin' so distant from everyone i've known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown parties that we've thrown
i've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
it's only been three years
look at how i've grown
i'm just in my zone
i call this shit the calm
yeah but i'm the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom and i swear my word is bond
everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
i'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
i know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't 'cause
you know everything gon' be all right i promise
i apologize to you know put y'all in this position vent to y'all but
40 mama always say dont ask permission
just ask forgiveness you know so uh forgive me yeah yeah
say
uh
and life is so insane
look what i became trying to make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
it's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention therefore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
tryin' to enjoy myself with tez in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
it's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
so i'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
hoping western union doing currency exchange
'cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
like how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn and i can only feel his pain
'cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
so i'm filling out the form at the counter once again
he say he love me i just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
i'm why your girl heart is in a sling
call me heartbreak drake i'm the hardest one to tame
as a man i'm just honest as an artist i'm a king
with my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
yeah and see this is the thang
what they viewing as bragging is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the single handed reason i remain me yeah
uh
i said i call this shit the calm
but im the furthest thing from calm
swear im putting on
but they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on like
man
are we done
i dont know are we
pops champagne
this here is on some truthful shit
it seems like everything i do you're used to it
and i hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
that's when i gotta hide what i'm feeling inside
so you still think i'm confident and damn
is this gonna last
you're up on a pedestal are we moving too fast
feel like i'm in crazy competition with the past
that's why i gotta ask
is anything i'm doin' brand new
brand new  brand new  brand new
is anything i'm doin' brand new
brand new  brand new brand new brand new
oh girl 
this here is something personal
i highly doubt this feeling is reversible
knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
that you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
so i don't ever question you and damn
i can't even find the perfect brush
so i can paint what's going through my mind
racing against myself but i'm a couple steps behind
that's why i gotta ask
is anything i'm doin' brand new
brand new  brand new  brand new
is anything i'm doin' brand new
brand new  brand new brand new brand new
oh girl 
is anything i'm doin' brand new
new new new new new

but fuck it i love it here i call it my birthplace
whenever i walk in they makin' the worst face
surrounded by filipinos i think of the worst case
watch blue and green diamonds i call it the earth face
i'm gettin' ya cake i tell you how ya dessert taste
i get a dessert plate
y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
i've been urkel for some years it's better bein' jaleel
though i rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
it's better drivin' a car with the letter b in the wheel
seat back
light sayin' tank on e

to be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
in the club with a model spillin' drinks on me

with or without a label man i'm committed to poppin'
and take over the summer
tour to tour hoppin'
i'mma meet a lot of women i'mma do a lot of shoppin'

i promise mama
i'mma do it cause i know i put you through it 
and i just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
and say my baby's famous and i knew it 
and it wasn't nothin' to it
i've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
the ballpoint run out
then all joints come out classic
rappers are fake we can all point one out
yeah
i'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the atf 
miss andreena mill
closer to my dreams i'm gettin' higher
yeah i feel it in my sleep
i said i'm gettin' higher
yeah
and closer to my dreams
whoa
sometimes it feels like i'll never move on
closer to my dreams
look
i took a plane to hawaii with d
and we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
from meetin' trey in atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
which made everything right with x 
i got too many records and not enough shows
far too many rappers and not enough 
well
you can fill the blank in
they tryna be the best
just tryna place in the rankin'
day care play pen drop out
to grade ten drop out
to summer '05 with the grey benz drop out
charcoal charger
racin' through back streets
on my craig david shit the artful dodger
shola ama
i told her i'mma
'bout to get my run on so hold the commas
times've changed now i'm older mama
and these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
and that's the realest shit i ever wrote
a compilation of mental thoughts that i never note
and hi haters
i'm back off of hiatus
how ya album doin'
i'm gettin' cake off of my latest
anticipated like the iphone
respected in any city that i roam
summertime
wintertime
dinnertime

 lights 'bout to go down curtains 'bout to close but
i want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out yeah man
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement
let me show you what it is
i was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
if you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like ooh wee
took 'em from white sneaks to louis
this metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
y'all don't really know me if you know me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
i done come all way from the days inn
and all the hotels that i stayed in
and i took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
and now i say it's sittin' at amazin'
girls tryna soho lobby us
hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
but i can't blame females
females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
what you really expect when i strut through town
two or three days i shut you down
chilin' with the homie trey songz
you call him the prince he rep two up two down
anyone i know get used to me
i'm far from the man that i used to be
and i don't ever really kick game
i know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'cause i'm a good dude who take pride in that
need good lovin' i'm providin' that
understand that i'm worldwide you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'cause i do things from the m town
to the uk and from spain back out to texas
this album's for my fans but yo this hook is for my exes
this one is for you girl you know who you are girl
you only show your face 'cause you know that i'm a star girl
what you tryna to make it don't ever mistake it
girl my time is limited and i ain't tryna waste it all on you
you had a chance now it's gone gone for you
oh you had a man now you don't now you don't
back to the basics i think i made it
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

tryna find another one tonight
and if it's you baby let yourself be seen

i got that work know what i mean
and i'm flexin' on my ex if you know what i mean
this one is for you girl you know who you are girl
you only show your face 'cause you know that i'm a star girl
what you tryna to make it don't ever mistake it
girl my time is limited and i ain't tryna waste it all on you
you had a chance now it's gone gone for you
oh you had a man now you don't
back to the basics i think i made it
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
with the other dudes she get picked for some take out
until they slip up and then they break out
but it's another story over here at drake's house
'cause i'm dripped up and i'm draped out
and i'm leaned back scopin'
lookin' for a woman that i should wife
who got just the right amount of loyalty
yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
we go la va ny to
sunshine and that heatstroke
and them fur hoods in that deep snow
we have breakfast in the bedroom
break bread downstairs in the basement
since jay and kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
guess me and the boy songz the replacement
this one is for you girl you know who you are girl
you only show your face 'cause you know that i'm a star girl
what you tryna to make it don't ever mistake it
girl my time is limited and i ain't tryna waste it all on you
you had a chance now it's gone gone for you
oh you had a man now you don't  now you dont
back to the basics i think i made it
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
let's go
it's what you all been waiting for ain't it
your weekly entertainment
for me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head claim it
i'm about to paint a picture you niggas go 'head frame it
since we getting seinfeld on some jerry and elaine shit
i flow far from mediocre
and if we talking cards i will fold him with the poker
you and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
so it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
and me i'm rolling with some brokers
like damn could you niggas get any broker
i got my new girl so content
just save yourself the embarrassment don't even approach her
disguise yourself go buy a costume
i am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
ugh and i was praying i would drop june
but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
so i keep it rocking for pete's sakes
you fake gangsta rappers are clich
and if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake
i'll be all in your face like no speak a la ingles
soon as you hear it you quote it
they try to be the one that i done left out the show with
but trust me i'm aware and my car's right there
is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives
'cause if you like it y'all should stick with me
my money good i ain't never had to flip a ki
a lot of ice a lot of cream like dickie dee
might cut the phone and disapear like michie mee
but i'ma try and have you on the trip with me
sliding through henri bendel like it's slippery
and your ex man is a hater officially
probably 'cause he know i'm exactly what you wish he be
yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
'cause i done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar
he just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
with her tongue sticking out like a michael jordan rookie card
let me address this pardon me while i fix
a couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
i guess he thought he could've been gotti in the flicks
but at this point i'm just poking a body with a stick
nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
and girls keep telling me i'm still this snobby
i tell them myself is who i am feeling probably
just because i got a buzz like a building lobby
it ain't a song that your ass finna skip
i tried to sell weed give me cash for the zip
the way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
millionaire shades fade with the waves
i smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
that just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
and that goes out to every nigga except trey
i'm outta here baby
they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
i wouldn't take it back nah not if they paid me
mr bet you that's expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
spitting a crock pot of bottomless gravy
the shit is so nasty how is it tasting
and you can probably find him walking out of a macy's
forget it girl they just thinking how to replace me
exit with a joke leave these niggas some hope
you took that 'ye beat and put that shit in a choke
well i'm thinking i should leave out on this note
nigga keep your two cents i ain't tryna leave you broke
life of a don lights keep glowing
come up in the club with that fresh shit on
and something crazy on my arm uh ahem
and here's another hit barry bonds
i don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
i show up right before the store close
and blow the fee from my last four shows
i do one song and use four flows
she used to be a christian before
now all she wanna do is shop for christian dior clothes
like baby those are cute i adore those
me and the salesman build a rapport so
he understand the fact that i'm spending offshore dough
cash only transactions homie
and please no receiptsthe feds like to explore those
they can't audit if they dont know i bought it
been doing it for years homie thoroughly i thought it
through what it do i am currently recording on a track
admitting most of my currencys imported
but too late now it's too legitimate to hit 'em with
a lawsuit even if those are acts that i did commit
repeat offender anita baker playing in the whip
as they pull me over my sweet surrender
i got a jewish lawyer as my lead defender
a menschkeit as they say hes a legal bender
and atf is present every regal member
the coalition is so efficient
you have to be invited or there's no admission
we know tradition we spend money
so don't try to compete if you in no position
i wish you would listen
i take you back to this trial
where i am about to be home again like new edition
my foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
used to record in the basement that renny grew his piff in
when pops turned over keys like a new ignition
if hov is jordan i guess i'm cool with pippen
'til i mention that i wanna play a new position
no team playing no screen setting
because i wanna win games coach i'm through assisting
the takeover the break's over nigga
and i'ma keep killing 'em until the day that drake's over
the wait's over the tape's coming
they bullshitting but i am equipped with great plumbing
the human mentality so eager to hate something
and try to play it off like it ain't jumping
and it's the predicament that you found drake in
the condo that i just purchased sound vacant
'cause i have just been sittin' in this cell
thinking what i could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
and whenever i'm flowing on the mic
aside from talking 'bout the d i'm throwing in your wife
i treat this one session as if it were my last
and i pretend tomorrow is the day i'm going in for life like that
okay
there comes a time
when you gotta be like
you know i've come this far on my own done a lot for myself
where to now you know
but i justi just tell myself this one thing
it was worth it it was all worth it
and by this time i understand that i ain't perfect
there ain't a pair of louis shoes i ain't purchased
and i was on some shit but they served they purpose
and i got verses i got verses
my sixteens should be arriving in hearses
they get bodied you see how i murk this
i switch flows much as my girl switch purses
yeah heartbreak drake i'll put it on your wife
if i put it in a verse then i put it on my life
liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
and tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
gogogogoddamn how time soars
i'm tryna get that house in toronto with pine floors
come over watch a season of flight of the conchords
and i try to put some lotion all over your contours
but ugh tell me you surfing let me know you on board
you can't seal up the bottle once all of the dom's poured
yes i swear to god girl i put it on lord
i'm tryna show you life through the tint on these tom fords
ethiopian girl ethiopian girl
with your long curly hair and yo' big ass boo tay
reading all them pro black pro female books
just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
you need a prescription a vision correction
i'm young and successful i'm living perfection
and man if '09 is when i'ma see mine
being cool ain't enough homie i'ma freeze time like that
take what you want take what you want
take what you want take what you want
but you gotta share it with the world
lately i've been murdering and avoiding conviction
this shit is like an addiction conflicting with what i do
shout out to k davis and my connect up at avis
cause every weekend i'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
fortunately i am at an elevated level
i'm celebrated at home and
i am high above it all

with a military jacket and some packed supplies
i won't say i'm the best 'til the stats arrive
and all these a list parties you fraternize
where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
but you don't never act surprised
you just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
and girl i used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint

don't you have a man 
why are you trying to be my girl 
i can't believe it 
don't you have a man 
it's all right with me my girl
we can do anything 
why you over there looking at me
while your man standing right beside you
the temporary happiness he might provide you
but you know and i know that nobody gon' do you like me
tryna save you like a goalie in line of sight
i know that i feel her but slowly i'm kinda like
i don't really wanna hit this girl
and still she want this chap's stick like napoleon dynamite
well i'ma give it to you honeybunches
you feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
all my other girls all up on that subtle shit
they don't wanna cut it they want a rapper to cuddle with
consequences keep weighin me down
so whenever she thinks i'm serious i'm playing around
it gets deeper and colder the funny thing is
i'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder like
don't you have a man 
why are you trying to be my girl
i can't believe it
don't you have a man 
it's all right with me my girl
we can do anything
look we had a lil' thing a wintertime fling
you some getback for your man mistreating
but that was then you know some hush hush
i ain't never really see a future in us
plus your man still there let's be fair
you'd do the same things to me
my feelings never did go past some late nigh  smash
i'on't wanna take the place of he
late nights 85 south on my way to the crib
and somebody got a song for me
i already know what you about 'cause i been the other man
and you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
it's my bad should've chose a wo man
but i'm in the mix with this lil' girl playing
i'm saying you need to do what you do
i'm not tryna take it any further with you c'mon
don't you have a man 
why are you trying to be my girl
i can't believe it
don't you have a man
it's all right with me my girl
we can do anything
ugh ugh i met her at the bar sipping on patrn
and now it's been three years off and on
'cause the same page we are rarely often on
'cause when i'm in she out and when she in i'm gone 
we lost contact like bausch  lomb
but regained it while she was building a house and home
wit this new cat sayin that he doin her right
it just proves that she don't know what to do with her life
'cause if so she wouldn't have to change her strategy
and wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
one minute she mad at me next minute it's all good
and i'm in her body like gray's anatomy
i don't understand why god sent me to you
and i cain't try to justify that foul shit we do 
all i know is that each time i'm stickin you
i think to myself damn if only her nigga knew but
don't you have a man 
why are you trying to be my girl
i can't believe it
don't you have a man 
it's all right with me my girl
we can do anything
don't you have a man 
why are you trying to be my girl
i can't believe it
don't you have a man 
it's all right with me my girl

you know how i get down
but look i'm just gon keep it real
i'd like to know if there is a chemical
imbalance in your makeup

sometimes i wonder wonder if you plan
half of this shit before i wake up
callin my ex girl or e mailin my mama 
you're the only one
that's causin me this drama
and then expect favors 
when you come in town
and i know if i see you guaranteed it's goin down
cause

you couldn't pay me
i respect a woman
but this bitch is crazy 
this bitch is crazy

she just oblivious to the whole shit like

hey
hahaha
you crazy man for real
ho
oh well nigga fall back ho
goddamn
i said it without sayin' it man
i gotta make it out or move quickly
can't allow the past to restrict me
but this time around they won't skip me
i am the last hope don't hesitate not even for a second
the hustle has become an obsession
i'm on the front line with my weapon
i am the last hope
can you imagine the last breath of christ
the last breath of christopher wallace on that faithful night
the last step that martin luther took as a man
i got the power of my world in my hand
the microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
i was born to provoke those born to die
i was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas
t dot motherfucker watch the world rape us
greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
it meets that pressure to success in the south
niggas watching what i say magnifying my mouth
i never take back talk i apply the force
hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
when the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather
so we can keep on hold it forever
my name's kardinall
i gotta make it out or move quickly
can't allow the past to restrict me
but this time around they won't skip me
i am the last hope don't hesitate not even for a second
the hustle has become an obsession
i'm on the front line with my weapon
i am the last hope
jealousy is something i haven't felt in years
there's nobody around for me to be jealous of
i bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
dawg i'm incredible fuckin unforgettable but when it comes to records i will eat it if it's edible
they say the futures always for seen
that's why i'm steady getting more money more cream
my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
i stay avoiding unlucky like 14
and people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
and even when its quite warm the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
the name's drake and i don't take it for granted
i can take it you offended cause i'm taken advantage man
i gotta make it out or move quickly
can't allow the past to restrict me
but this time around they won't skip me
i am the last hope don't hesitate not even for a second
the hustle has become an obsession
i'm on the front line with my weapon
i am the last hope
i've got it made thats what i'm talking about
going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
so me and my lady can ride
check i wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school backpack
grey range black ac'
put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
double that school dance fresh j's new pants
back when fuck bitches get money was the new chant
it started out about a boy like hugh grant
now i'm a young man doin things you can't
but you can't call me champagne charlie
i campaign hardly
my damn chain glitter ruby red
the type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
i live it thought you knew this
i swear that we been through this
your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to do list
cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
bingo money ain't a thing ho
that prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
i ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
cause when i'm in the spot it's popping like christopher's single
more videos

drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded

when it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
finally here i'mma star with the timing

yeah look
me and sos we from two different walks of life
mutually we understand there's a problem we don't talk to vice
the watch is yellowy green
that's sum awkward ice
i never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
i'm awful nice lyrics that i often write
inspire no talent rappers to get off the mic
and i could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe man
i flow so cool like autumn nights
when i body this tell me if the coffin's light
but don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
mislead drake that is not at all polite
it's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
bet i get a co sign somethin' like no time
they'll be tryna sub a nigga in like quizno's
all i need is some weight my scale some money for bail
a lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
nigga my drink my smoke a bird on e
and somethin' heavy on my waist man i'm easy to please
i need my moms my pa a bottle of cliqua
the whole atf you know who we are
my women my money and leave me the keys
of somethin fast and i'm good man i'm easy to please
i never lived in a fancy house
i grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
so i never really had a chance to escape
fast forward to '07 ain't nothin' much changed
the d still scope the crip
and the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
and told the same damn sad story different publishin'
d boys jugglin' single mother strugglin'
the media try to cover it
but the cottonelle two ply in your neighbor's house i'm on some other shit
me and drake from two different walks of life
but both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
my left arm's like david wells
my right arm's like holliday so i'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
for just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
shit i know they want me locked up
all i need is some weight my scale some money for bail
a lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
nigga my drink my smoke a bird on e
and somethin' heavy on my waist man i'm easy to please
i need my moms my pa a bottle of cliqua
the whole atf you know who we are
my women my money and leave me the keys
of somethin fast and i'm good man i'm easy to please
please
d d d d damn what did i consume
something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
i bet you it's the room cause i don't do no drugs
or maybe it's that 'tron cause i sure do have a buzz
baby either way i'm throwed and i am on a mission
so if your ears a virgin i'd advise you not to listen
cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't christian
it's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
baby holla at your nigga i got that shit for low
okay maybe i don't but guarantee someone i know
wait let me slow it down  i'm gettin' ahead 
plus it's gettin' hot so i'm a take a seat instead 
i'm lucky i ain't dead  i'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
we all of age and i ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
and in this game i'm a tidal when the tides small
so drop me in and i release just like a time bomb
every record that i've done the station here they play it
this the city that i run this the shit that i created
they tellin' me i'm the one and i haven't even made it
maybe i'm hearing things cause i'm feeling like i'm faded

i'm feelin' like i'm faded faded f faded f faded faded f faded f faded faded
f faded f faded
i just set the 40 ups and i got two blunts
bagging sour diesel stinking like i got a few stumps
im sipping on lean while you got fruit punch
getting faded like clothes ive been washed too much
man smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
blow a smoke ring over my head its a halo
wake up and bake up spend the whole day slow
head in the clouds but my face low
ayo i got them percocets you want a percocet
yo' girl got some nice titties yeah a perky set
i purchase cess cause everyday i work with stress
high while im driving its like im triyn to work a jet
and i smoke like a choo choo train
so i stay low key like ja rule new name
and i can barely walk but its all good and dandy
man im so high i need a pilot to land me
every record that i've done the station here they play it
this the city that i run this the shit that i created
they tellin' me i'm the one and i haven't even made it
maybe i'm hearing things cause i'm feeling like i'm faded

cuz i just bought a truck

and naw it ain't a buick
i never rendezvous it
i'm just in the 'burg with trigga
and i'm faded off the fluid
i made alot of money
then i went ahead and blew it
now i'm trying to make it back
so how the fuck you wanna do it
my nigga you better do itdo it
i would say this here's a practice song
and lately i been out in hollywood
just acting wrong
what up to jackie long
i fuck with jackie long
i clown other dudes on the low
i like to laugh alone
i get my cash alone
that's why i shop alone
this here's my uncle's car
i drop it and the top is gone
your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
and girl i heard your man a fed don't bring that cop along
i'm running every single light

this here's a classic jump
that big things are popping on

and i ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
still ride in the drop
with my mind on the knot
you niggas never take what i got
for my underdog
yeah
9th wonder
don't judge me man
they tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
they say we lack substance
me 'te and el 'bout to prove 'em wrong though
ugh we know what you're thinking love
you think we out smoking and drinking love
pushing big whips chains clinking love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
we know how you speculate
thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
claim we early and be showing up extra late love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
they don't be saying how i'm humble i'm hella nice
or that i've been approached to sign to roc a fella twice
they just tell you all the rumors they heard
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like amel and bryce
my groove theory is that when you too cheery
they try to bring you down to the level they at
well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky
that's why i am little nicky to these devils in rap
but uh they ain't thinking drake get smart girl
nah they probably think i'll break your heart girl
haha i can't lie you probably right about it
and if you give me the ass quick i'll probably write about it
but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound
i mean i spit that influential shit from my town
i don't know why you sitting on the couch
when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down
you think taking your purse off
will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i could've been a local emcee
and you probably would've been worse off
so i'ma take this hat off and i'ma hit it till i'm back soft
and then i backs off
'cause you thinking you can predict what happen
you the reason i'm thinking i'm getting sick of rapping
ugh we know what you're thinking love
you think we out smoking and drinking love
pushing big whips chains clinking love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
we know how you speculate
thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
claim we early and be showing up extra late love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and
swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
well you can think what you want but
i think you've been watching too much bet uncut
you need to get real and check out my real life
i ain't a tip drill don't care what it smell like
but if you feel like putting all your notions aside
and talking to a real nigga i'd gladly oblige
first name phonte i'd be pleased to date ya
college educated got degrees in papers
but i'm from the south where if you ain't snapping
or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
such an anomaly speak so well
and talk so collegy such an astonishing
contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
on behalf of them i offer my apologies
maybe with me you'll unlearn
putting all niggas in a box of concerns
me 'cause i ain't dumb shit i'm well read like sunburn
and after me you'll never leave no stone unturned
ugh we know what you're thinking love
you think we out smoking and drinking love
pushing big whips chains clinking love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
we know how you speculate
thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
claim we early and be showing up extra late love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
yeah they say you never judge a book by its cover
though you appear as materialistic just like the others
so i followed your words to take 'em in
and i don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
that's when i felt that i would need to
do more than just look you up and down
to see if i could read you
and try to get inside your head only
not just stick my fingers in your middle
to get you to spread for me
so what i learned on my path to discover
your story took one ugly turn after another
i saw we wasn't on the same page
i would've gave you strong play
but your words rubbed me the wrong way
so now i'm closing the case
you only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
no el will never judge a book by its cover
until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
ugh we know what you're thinking love
you think we out smoking and drinking love
pushing big whips chains clinking love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
we know how you speculate
thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
claim we early and be showing up extra late love
but you don't really know me like you think you know me
me and you so crucial baby
and that champagne so fuchsia baby
i do things that you ain't use to baby
and take you back home to st lucia baby
when raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
that's a metaphor did i lose ya baby
when you are wet and covered in sweat
i'll wipe ya ass down like boosie baby
i love all my feedback
tell me to give it to ya if you need that
touch right there whatever the speeds at
if it's over fast then i promise you will relapse
forget what you guess that i'm on and who is in your past
i'm refreshing and grown
just charge that cell that i message you on
and if you lets us girl i'mma bring the dressing along
you hear that professional tone
half of that's ice and the rest is patron
show up on time for the class i'm teaching
cause guaranteed i'mma bring a lesson along
and you just gotta bring the breastes along
instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
i confess this address to you
and i'm the post man looking for a slot i can put it in
with no new york number mom still upstairs
i'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
you so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
yeah
i know i told you before i'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'cause mine's it polo and yours is vickie
and they just spread all over the floor like
you feel so good
you smell so good
you feel so warm
just like i knew you would
can't let you go
can't let you go
i can't let you go
you were late to school
i'm gonna have to see you after class
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to teach you
teach you
someone's gonna have to teach you
you can call me professor
but baby you broke the rules
you won't get the grade you want
unless you stay after school
you work it off 
baby i can give you extra credit 
but there's something else
girl can i frisk you
search your body for
you look so guilty to me
if i make you nervous
it's 'cause you're hidin' wmd's
and i'm gonna sentence you
baby you can do your time on me
i can't let you go
i can't let you go
you were late to school
i'm gonna have to see you after class
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to teach you
teach you
someone's gonna have to teach you
just for the moment
for tonight
can i make you mine
is it me is it mine
can i love you all my life
i can't stop missing you wish i was still with you
i can't stop missing you
no no no no
i can't stop missing you wish i was still with you
i can't stop missing you
no no no no
nah
i never needed advice about
all the things you liked to do when it was lights out
i drove nice cars i got a nice house
but now i'm steady missing you like a strikeout
i always wished i would've cared more
that's my only feeling inside whenever i get a song done
i'm scared that every girl i care for
will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
ya and when she not by my side
and i hear that she gone
now it's like a shock to my pride
i don't care if she know
'cause that's basically just a male ego
speaking aloud to some real people
but you can bounce back
go ladies
more records more sex more babies
yeah wanna grant one of my wishes
tired missing you i'm tryna make you a missus
i miss the way you kiss
i miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
and i miss you staying here till the morning

miss the way you love me too much

yo what's going on this is drake
and i'ma let you know what you about to witness
this right here is a drake and dj smallz collaboration
so i'm from canada my man's from down south
ya understand the number one dj in the south to be exact
you heard that in the vmas you heard that wherever he goes
my man smalls is out there down south
same time reppin' for toronto canada
ya know what i mean
so this right here listening to right now is the official southern smoke special edition
i call it the room for improvement mixtape cause i'm not perfect
and i bet neither are you if you listening
so you need to just accept what's there know what i mean
but look you need to just let this play out
from track one to track whatever however many i put on here
you need to just listen to this cause look man this is the first time
canadian down south my man smallz your boy drake
you know what it is man so just tune in nigga
thank you ms graham for coming today you look very nice today sorry that's not professional i guess they say in canada don't mingle business with pleasure or something like that so we have to talk about aubrey or how he likes to be called drake as i always like to say there is room for improvement in his learning from piano he talks a lot huh he socialize when i'm teaching okay and when it's time for him to play he doesn't have pianist hands if you need example me mozart and ray charles all of us have pianist hands i'm the only one living with this hands i guess heh i'm kidding i'm just kidding umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason but there is so much room for improvement you know speaking of improvement i don't think you ms graham need any of it heh i'm kidding i'm just kidding haha
uh yeah man vo
back again like we never left huh
i'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
anybody thats special
you know i wanna be honest with you women so i'mma start off like this
uh look i'm bold from the get go go by the title of drake
and treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
i'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
when i say i've been disappointed i'm addressing a few
i finesse then i groove
while most of the 8 to 9's in my past
now get a rating thats less than a 2
its true i been talking to aleshia keisha and nadia
and shadia had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
payback to the same chicks from way back
never call now they wanna be where i stays at
now they got the new boy i'm trying to move forward
and pass me classy something like drew lord
a new me cool see i never get around
if i dont change now i dont think i'll ever settle down
even if i gotta travel a bit
i'll go around the world and back
cause i know that once i have it thats it and uh
you can't just love me like they do
i need someone special in you
i know that out there theres a few
see i've been searching i don't what to do
can you help me
she gotta be special
by that i mean that you gon hold me down
you gotta be special
cause you never know how people stick around
gotta be special
a girl i can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
yeah my name ain't change but i'm far from the man that i used to be
since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
ever since the demo dog
and groupies are gettin' brave
now they ask me for
rappers i write 'em a verse
and ask me to spit it
but i pay no mind though
cause they know i know
hard as these niggas working man
they won't sign so
drake and vo back
i take it you know that
you take it sitting down
or you can take it to gold black
and since drake done took it from curls to waves
its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
i mean i had my share of women
now a nigga gettin' girls for days
with most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
but from georgia to bk and all around the world
get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
if you've been hurt and you alone be steady
these the same dudes from rewind grown and ready and uh
you can just love me like they do
i need someone special in you
i know that out there theres a few
see i've been searching i dont know what to do
can you help me
special
by that i mean that you gon hold me down
gotta be special
cause you never know how people stick around
special
a girl i can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
yeah my name ain't change but i'm far from the man that i used to be
look theres requirements to be an admirer
still the new version of fresh needa a nia or tyra
so we can be jenny and swayze
i told you i'm careful with my heart girl many have played me
or maybe it's karma
they say is a charmer
halfway to a knight so i stay in a armor
i'm fire on the move
a tire looking smooth
i'm not perfect but i got a desire to improve
i'm special
like kids in a graduating class
having more trouble than others when adding basic math
need you to be special like areba to cootmore
double o top secret agents with suits on
something so deep it da drown me
friends are some cool dudes
i vouch for the people around me
on your end its simple
all you have to do
is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh
you can't just love me like they do
i need someone special in you
i know that out there theres a few
see i've been searching i don't what to do
can you help me
special
by that i mean that you gon hold me down
special
cause you never know how people stick around
gotta be special
a girl i can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
yea my name ain't change but i'm far from the man that i used to be

check the verses i'm writin' you might wanna learn it
you hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
so now you at the store for some blank cds
you can't see me for your sake might wanna return it
'cause if you bring them discs home to ya girl
she'll forget you and i'll be the only one she concerned with
to the people that ignored me before this
this one is for you as a song re recorded
funny thing is you just notice me now
but i was here along your vision's just been distorted
i'm so throwed wilin' in this you ask me what the business is
and i'll write a sixteen and record it
the waiting is over i think music needed
drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
people in the south want it chopped and screwed
i got this dude they expectations i'ma exceed it
like a single with only backgrounds
y'all record and when it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
finally here i'ma star with the timin'
my swagger is chill and my flow is reclinin'
this for anybody that's searchin' for cash

two years ago a friend of mine
asked me to kick some new school lines
and so i sent him a rhyme it was fresh to death
now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
then i hopped inside the cadillac
the chauffeur drove off and we never came back
stance on lean leg up on the wall
my niggas chill why you niggas wanna ball
i'm satisfied with a little why you niggas want it all

southern smoke

 this is the remix right here
 so if you got some 
put ya hands in the air
 southern smoke
now a days you sayin' that i should go jermaine i should go pharrell
either or my nigga make sure you don't get shelled
 make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
so you could get checks cut like benedict in ocean's twelve
this ain't brad pitt i gotta admit
i'm sick of seeing chicks in that louis v and that plaid shit cause it's a bad fit
they say my father lives through me so this is just basically how my dad spit
i know my cash come quick when it's sunny
you know a girl is special if i stick with her honey
if it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
and if it wasn't for money nick would still have skummy
so guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
to jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
if you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you run for cover
a week later you might find ya click in a hearse boy
i take time arrange that 
some kill just to claim that 
switch countries exchange that 
you cannot get jack for freeee
and my proceeds and cash right 
there's no need to stash right 
got the same four g's from last night 
you cannot take that from me homie
moneys the reason my best friend got murdered
so with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
milk the game turn it to butter look how i turned it
no chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
take that dick put to your lips and insert it
where the hell is self respect go when them checks show
you sleep with them anywhere hell is your bed for
you always on your back what the hell is your legs for
i know walk that strip get my grip

from the night before at the club i was up i'm tryna live
only twenty two my nig 'bout to be twenty three ya dig
time don't wait for none of us that's why i gotta chase my dreams
make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
and be half the man my dad was i thank god he was in my life
i realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
either i need to make this music work or move from the earth
i'm preachin' fire need a choir 'bout to take you all to church
my congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
we in the race to fame blowin' pass the pit stops
i heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
and all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
yeah nick cop but he ain't never get popped
how we gonna get pop fans give 'em a quick shot
now i get ya chick hot with my wrist watch

reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
it ain't as easy as it looks we go through some shit

then you show us respect then we'll say you legit
and this is the life that i lead from am to pm
i'm trynna get that cash then watch how tall it grows
soon as we get the ass we start callin' 'em ho's
the concept you don't grasp i'm guessin' you too old
and this is the life that i lead from am to pm
ayo i stay up every evening write that shit that they believe in
djs run it they approach me and it's praise i be receiving
from the night befo' at the club fake id my record spins
got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
well guess again slip around the back and get it crackin'
and all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
hundred grand nickle f that nigga's the next to win
virgina gon' rep for him and memphis represent for me
to the tenth degree tennekey t dot to the country y'all
orange mound and whitehaven and back up north to montreal
i ain't ashamed my city ain't on the map
people get to thinking they really light that fire realize they ain't born to rap
so they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
maybe they can bring they career back
but these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
cause i'm on set make it work break even on 9 to 5's
cigarettes and lotto tickets tryna keep that grind alive
all my uncles they hit the casino when they get they check
my cousins they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
this can't be life dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
purple drink and trips to kroger's just to get they money stacked
rest in peace to skummy this reality not funny rap
you think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at
it ain't as easy as it looks we go through some shit
you cut us a check then we go through some hits
then you show us respect then we'll say you legit
and this is the life that i lead from am to pm
i'm trynna get that cash then watch how tall it grows
soon as we get the ass we start callin' 'em ho's
the concept you don't grasp i'm guessin' you too old
and this is the life that i lead from am to pm
this the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
back back southern town fans get to tippin'
chasin' fat stacks runnin' down grands and submission
i don't back track every single sound for me different
i don't own no ice just got clean rap
don't ever two step i just rock lean snap
we could take it out to houston where the rides all glossed up
anybody i'm standin' beside's all bossed up
burglar minded they say i'm servin' them rhymers
and me and nickel f go together like burgers and diners yes
i'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
with trays in both hands place an order i can cater uh
i got the diamonds in my teeth flow
memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
peep though when i get fed up its sped up
riding through the streets just reclining in my seat hoe
uh them city lights is looking brighter its 3 am in the morning an' the pen is like a lighter

lady you say i stay in the house til four
we don't even go out no more
its always the same eh
always complainin
its obvious baby
i guess you don't watch the news
you see theres a lot to lose
cuz we got a baby
and people are shady
my generation is changin
aside from the fact
the dealers have customers they provide with the crack
front of the buses taken
and we deny it from the back
you can die where you from or die where you at
don't put it past them
i don't think that they understood
my friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up
if your dads in the hood
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good
lady somebody shot up the place right by
where i work and i think they might

cuz i gotta feed you
i hope that i see you again again
hope that i see you see you
lately i don't know about the friends that i hang with
i'm nervous round my boys it depends on their anguish
depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
with dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
depends on what they do to achieve that
robbing rb singers 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
get the info leave with ya money man thats how the world is
thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
streets are seedy i call em sesame

coincidink not likely not a chance
how can we be so aware of these problems and not advance
at least start put a bid in its hard just to fit in
a lot of people only play they part when they spittin
but i don't think that they understood
they using this darkness for penetration in the hood
i took the ivory way in and yes i'm glad that keenan could
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good
love's lost
love's gone
love lost
love is gone
look
in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
rappers they tend to be smilin'
because they swimmin' in women
most of em seeking favors
they come in secret flavors
that's why i envy omar
because so far i'm nowhere close to malik and deja
and that's some higher learning
trying to excel with the brake on
i'll have you stuck in the same spot
with the tires burnin'
and i'm a liar turnin' 19 jaded with no faith
in any female that's askin what i was earnin
i met this recent lady
she knew a piece of sadie by spinners
i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
cause she ain't give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
it's like i'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
now i'm out of both and i've been thinkin' of alisha lately
i'm all alone i got a feelin it's on
cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh
love's lost
love's gone
love lost
love is gone
some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
circling workplaces
and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
they get to first bases
then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
he wanna know what the first trace is
now you like macgyver
cause you sneakin' around
and she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
i can relate to that
i had to take it back a couple a years
when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact
i bet that they knew it cause in my mind i play through it with
and in the end i listen but i don't see me as they do
cause it's my opinion my life my potentials for my wife
and i used to be eager to buy em the world
maybe i'm confused about what i desire from girls
either way i'm all alone got a feelin' it's on
cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh
love's lost
love's gone
love lost
love is gone
check
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is confusing
since i ain't made them a purchase yet
but there's logic behind it
emotions double and they try to cover up
like a mansion with the projects behind it
i tend to freak with this
i get a girl and pretend that i love the spending
and all she gave was a decent kiss
thinking she been spoiled
but golddiggin' is nothing when you can shovel for days
and come up with tin foil
we could dissect it see
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
gave her nothing
her reputation's in jeopardy
cause it ain't take a spree of that shopping to get her next to me
collectively i look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and calling and texting me
for thinking that exists i got a feeling i'm wrong
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
love's lost
love's gone
love lost
love is gone
look if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background with your asses shakin'
hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya'll part of the speech 'cause
i'm from the city where people be gettin' lazy
litterin' in the streets
and the club district is poppin' like literally every week
and promoters'll push flyers
money exchange hands
liars sell you they dreams
and dummies exchange plans
hustlers give you events
bouncers give you pass
directors give em a shot
so girls'll give up the ass
and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
daffy and bugs its all laughing and hugs
til the dude catch a plane
and she back where she was
right back on the bus
it's a shame cause now at his window
she throwin' bricks like shaq in the clutch
you can see that's shes colder
'cause he doesn't hold her
fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
know that he tried ta told her
that he couldn't mold her
if this the type of chick you wanna be when you older i say
now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
and i'm one of em the other four you know who you are
but if you gotta think through
chances are that it ain't you
i single handedly carry out what you can't do
and see i take a couple of breathers
and then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
if you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
go ahead i couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
but uh the in  the out and the plan's seeming ill
whenever i'm out in memphis the man seen as trill
and every verse the man seem to kill
you can find him with black jays and socks like i'm andreena mill
japan and brazil the audience screaming
and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
advances to deals financing appeals
the hustles i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
look if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background with your asses shakin'
hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
i ask you to have some patience
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya'll part of the speech 'cause
uh yea get in my slick rick mode
n'a mean i'm a tell ya a story real quick
look she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
crib was 2 mil plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
even if the house was ten grand
and there was no pool
would i still be without my swim fan
the ceiling could be higher
she making requests
don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her
and purses are light now
she use 'em all the time
so she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
and she simply a new model
stay spendin dollars
but she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
at times she a solid chick
and i'm a sucka for the cuties
so she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
chillin on the linen she all up in the closet so much
got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
want the diamonds on the face in the center
nice guys finish last so i'm winnin every race that i enter and she a
video girl
eh yo you have to listen
i'm in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldn't call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same
and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cuz i can't stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
my old girl would say
look at vida guerrera
there's no need to compare her
i bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
i bet she's out meetin' directors instead
and frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
be a teacher open up shop if you can do nails fine
apply for a business loan and i'll bet you that they'll sign
if you a real dime
poppin as if its your only option
girl there's things to do
other than jail time
look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
or pasha and sasha esther baxter
melyssa ford or katy or anyone after
i just give my opinion for laughter
or maybe to think on
so next time you out at the club
and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
you just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
look you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
and as ya man i won't back down first
but they got you doing soft core background work
that messed up like an officer that pulls you over
and he ask questions later and pat down first
but you ain't thandie newton and this ain't crash here
the resolutions passed baby this ain't last year
look i got a message i'll say it
i got some beats still
regina hall and garcelle and elise neal
young girls these here women with big dreams
role models that you can watch on the big screen
if you refuse to change and you that chick still
respect yourself don't be convinced that these tricks will
you got an audience believe it or not
my cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill
video girl
eh yo you have to listen
i'm in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldn't call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same
and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cuz i can't stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself
and i ain't trying ta generalize every video girl you n'a mean
say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
accept the fact that there's times that you gotta better yourself
you know as a person man i love to see my black women strong single
independent doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
video you n'a mean its a wonderful thing baby so uh don't hate me for
this one ladies just take my advice you n'a mean cuz its like uh
and she beautiful and honey dances
and you always downtown making money transfers
and anything the color of braces she get excited
she always showing up at these places she get invited
she a video girl
what up this kim damn ive been trying to get at you all week why dont you call me back
okay i lied damn i swear just call me back
okay alright  hit it too why dont you just call me back
yeah this dedicated to canada man
the whole up north
a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter
but listen
i met this new girl late june or early july
i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
now it's december i'm driving and she's like where's my hi
it's weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy
see that was a segue i believe the matter
is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
where the timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in
the winter cars come out the summer cars go in
and some places is breezy and some it start snowin'
and if you planning family vacations you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late she seen them videos
where cancun college students pouring water on their titties
yeah man it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls y'know wanna get close you might think they the one
but just wait nah mean take it slow
forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet
since i'm driving i ask her how to get to the suite
she doesn't answer opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat
she's bold but i roll with it i'm impressed cause she's sweet
then she says i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat
i mean the lyrics are good but i'm obsessed with the beat
i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good
there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat
off this i'm kinda taken back for a second
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do and it's kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch
until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern
and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho
yeah uh i told ya'll i had a story for you right
uh ya man it's what it is
and now i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
but my boy say i'm actin different because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
she tellin everyone i'mma hold here down
tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her
instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
but then spring shows up and it's dallas in this bitch
the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
when we were together it seeming like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana
and it's a shame she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
i guess i lost another one to the wintertime
i miss you most of all my darling 
 strolling in the park 
and watching winter turn to spring 
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up
now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
so we can get back to them cognac nights
with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and we'd assembled a trio a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
but this summer is different it's a two man operation
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
instead of dress up i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
the face the breast the bras the toes
i'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
cause it's a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
we'll never talk again scary and true
that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified
it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through
yet i can't seem to find it every girl that possesses it
only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
and when they talk about they past and lovers
and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself now least there's some room to ride
there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring
yeah ho
it's drake uh uh ho
do that dance do that dance
you special girl don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
look i ought to be thankful with women i have plenty of luck
and when it comes to relationships many is stuck
look at fifty you make love thirty you have sex
somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
or maybe before i'm here waiting to score
it's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
instead these girls taking it raw
now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
forget wait till it's right now it's wait till it's more
wait till he get gets a deal girl wait till the tour
so they dance to attract me advance and attack me
to the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie
but once they have my pants and my khakis
i tell them i'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
because i hate waking up undressed with a dame
and guessing her name i hope this shit is destined to change
you special girl don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
you special girl don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
i don't get it it's like my fairy was sick
it's like i meet the perfect girl and she put me through some various shit
it's something that i can rarely predict
all i know is that i can never find the love that tyler perry depict
i'm guessing maybe shemar moore isn't really all pure
maybe i lie to myself and it's like a small cure
i tell it all to her
i gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
because really what is a window without a car door
why i can't settle for one instead of all four
mu mind is clouded this shit complex here
jason tell me i'mma have a baby by next year
psychic told me i'mma have three kids
i don't want my daughter making a song like teairra mari did
so i'mma change yeah this summer is grown
i'm running along before i raise one of my own
you special girl don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
you special girl don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

ahahaha the boys of summer are here man
ayo trey i got something mean for this one boy
chances are most of the days you was lying around
i made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
by nineteen i might seem destined for millions
promoters on my ass so i'm guessing they filled in
i take cues from my big boy popz
i'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
they getting foul on the star
but it's all eyes on me like i'm copying some vows for the bar
get it
guess not
picture me not strive
to land in the top ten slip in the top five
same thing in the top four trust i'm hot boy
maybe even the top three trey you got me
nowadays i peak they interests
especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
money making brothers should take notes
see broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
somebody get the waiter
they need a second plate a this knowledge
if you ain't got it you could catch it later
my money and love is separate before i commit to date her
i put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
it ain't about the rims on my truck
ain't about the ice on my watch
ain't about the coupe or my truck
baby it's about the game
ridin' low
layed back in the seat when i creep
that's just how i roll
with some fresh nice ones on my feet
girl that's how it goes
and i'm tryin' to find a chick i can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
cause it ain't all about that no more
it ain't about the rims on my truck
ain't about the ice on my watch
ain't about the coupe or my truck
baby it's about the game
it ain't about the rims on my truck
ain't about the ice on my watch
ain't about the coupe or my truck
baby it's about the game
when you ask why i hustle in the streets that's just who i be
yo i live for the dough for the flow for feelin' free
ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
but without it all i'm still about the game
the haters wanna hate but it ain't no thing no
because the ladies choose to love me 
it ain't about the rims on my truck
ain't about the ice on my watch
ain't about the coupe or my truck
baby it's about the game
it ain't about the shoes that i've got
ain't about my dough or my rocks
ain't the life i live it don't stop
baby it's about the game
southern smoke

yeah yeah 
they say he wanted the bounce back
i can easily make them admit that the bounce back
without knowing exactly where my accounts at
yeah you best believe
that i often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
so they don't like me
they throw parties and yet they never invite me
i can't lie sometime it bother me slightly
either way the true fans yell
i appear calm and it's obvious of who can't tell
and no this ain't blu cantrell
this is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
couple things i do damn well
and the way that i jack son you figure drake knew sam l
i'm for real though
i'm from memphis i'm often labeled as trill so
they stay kicking it with me like a field goal
see i'm humble but i live fame
for more deals on the table than abridge game ahh
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i don't deserve all this love 
i can't believe that it's just really you and me and i know
i can't explain myself all this love 
even when the sun don't shine i know you're my sunshine
and even if the sun outside we can anything baby
i need to feel you next to me you want to feel me next to you
we can do anything you want to do
tell me the next morn baby
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i don't deserve all this love 
i can't believe that it's just really you and me and i know

uh i'm bringing back hip hop
me and my nigga drake
va toronto hip hop
aiight let me take my jacket off
unlace the timbs here again comes the jabberjaw
this time i'm blabbing on
these rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
i got the gift like santa claus
flow got spring like a catapult
matter fact the flow supreme like diana ross
i'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
niggas acting like scummy was they nigga
wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
i know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
i said nah lets keep it peaceful
my nigga was a true weed source
he gave it to us for a cheap cost at prices we all could eat off
a real street dog
the type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
we have an impostor alert the doctor
bout to hit him up with the chopper like blaka
shock em like blanka from street fighter heat got a
hurricane kick murder everything quick
look my new ryu nine is stupendous
why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
my crew lie you guys into ditches
i said it and meant it the scorpio's mind has many dimensions
i'll say it in intent sentence indent on instant pimpin
hope your listenin' to my diction
if you are then you now should be itchin'
that it's crack we placed in your stereo system
yeah i be at your burial trippin'
nickelus f from richmond va
the scorpio's mind is not a game to play wit all day
i've been hated by many wanted by plenty
disliked by some but confronted by none
since they don't show me sincerity i load up lock up
take shots at em i guess you could call it a parody
and compared to d
they one fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon dude you a pear to me
if that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
you got blind heaters in my sweats is a mind reader
and when the psychic get to touching my palm
seein' your physical the things that you never say to me visible
especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
cause i'm harnessing a weapon won't you pardon my reflection
mirror mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
and play around to perfection i'm the spitting image
my verbal camp is vivid i told you i'm spitting image
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
my verbal campus is villanova and those of you feelin hova
and writing college rhymes look the thrill is over
let me assist you like a specialist
so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
it's not a problem wit x i guess i'm a pessimist
which means if shit goes bad i say i expected this
and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate
instead of understanding its a tune of hate
the city's mine like oklahoma's a sooner state
and we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
so why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
you ain't morris chestnut you lighter and less cut
and lets be honest by now you should be your own scholar
you still a proteg that's the reason i don't holler
you got rappers being repetitive actors
you stay ahead of the game i'm ahead of the practice boy
yeah ren mof haha
it's drake man it's drake manyeah
ayo ren this that gritty shit here man
i'ma have to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean
ho southern smoke
very few give you that truth it's either they can't do it with lyrics
or can't do it in spirit they cancel what they doin'
the samples that they usin' can't get through the clearin'
i'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
my father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up
with just being a florist so the choir sang his chorus
and he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
because money is an issue your son he gon' miss you
and plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
now you lookin' for exes you ain't never expect this
you end up doing time and me i end up with a step sis
nobody passing judgment they question where the drugs went
you know i hold you down because without you i'd be a wasn't
and mommy i'mma support her i keep it all in order
see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
but
i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
it's stress my nigga
i'm just tryna live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo
i'm just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo
this is my life and so the rest has kinda been cool
question what i been through
i write a verse addressin' it
and yes i might offend you
picture when i was in school
me being the closest thing to black
and guess what rap music what i was into
rest of the kids were sheltered
i never liked to fight
but when someone called me a nigga
i'd punch em i couldn't help it
now i'm grown i can say what it is
it's parents that got these black and filipino nannies raisin' they kids
and your daddy want it very right
i make you happy plus i'm jewish he don't approve
i think he want you to marry white
he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white
cause black is black honey even if he's very light
and so i never been for dinner at they places
always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces
i live it so the case is whether drake is
way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist
am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best
like girls with double d's i got a lot on my chest
there's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
and yes when i'm dismissed after a tedious listen
i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician
homie i probably could've been on tv consistent
an artist like pablo maybe petey's assistant
and my mindset is come and get me
i'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
daughter and her grandson nigga get the handgun
if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond
that have you niggas laying out on the curb they some hitmen
last couple of months i done probably been around the world and back
and i don't wanna question half the places nick been
sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
to feel what i'm about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
and they try to make you out as a lie
it's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
it's a lose lose why even try
when your ideas so frequently get rejected
people just get neglected
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
and the motives to try and make them a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
they just wanna say that you ain't around
i mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
chorus 
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try try try try
and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
than most of these rappers running the game
certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
there's time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range
also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent
sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers
and watched the game from the bleachers
because i'm really tend to need what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
i wasted out late at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i'm working hard on the winter
so this album is a labor of love
you say as long as i'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
that she can rest without a toss and a turn
because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on tv
that's exactly why i often get burned
but i'm gonna try to
chorus 
uh what up y'all yeah
soundtrakk what's popping baby
if y'all ain't know
i go by the name of lupe fiasco
representing that first and fifteenth yeah uh
and this one right here i dedicate this one right here
to all my homies out there grinding
you know what i'm saying legally and illegally haha
you know what i'm talking about
so check it out uh
first got it when he was six didn't know any tricks
matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
landed on his hip and busted his lip
for a week he had to talk with a lisp like thisss
now we can end the story right here
but shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
yeah he said it was something so appealing
he couldn't fight the feeling something about it
he knew he couldn't doubt it couldn't understand it
branded since the first kickflip he landed uh
labeled a misfit a bandit
ka kunk ka kunk ka kunk his neighbors couldn't stand it
so he was banished to the park
started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
and so he kick push kick push
kick push kick push coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick push kick push
kick push kick push coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel looking for a place to be
so let's kick
and push
and coast
uh uh uh
what up lupe
chi town check
my style is very tennessee mixed with some terry kennedy
people barely remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay but check
it gets boring growing up in memphis
tryna become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckily my aunt workin' as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
if i'm stayin' in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she said you need to be doing something other than skatin'
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i'mma let him know that you comin' honey he's waitin'
so now it's me in old school checkered plaid
playing chess looking through some old school record ads
he knew i didn't really wanna post here
opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
and now i coast clear take a deep breath
feeling like the pope's here homie this is recess
this is each test life's ever given me
a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes i'm literally larnell lewis with a
kick and a snare a kickflip in the air
the kid's sick denim jeans put a rip in a pair
just so the space ain't restricted in here breathe again
think it's obvious that they need my soul
my cousin's after doe like re mi fa so
i said auntie this is a safe career
she said drake i told you there was no skatin' here
so i kick push kick push

just the freedom was better than breathing they said
an escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy they needed to break out
they'd head to any place with stairs
any good grinds the world was theirs
and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said there's no skating here

look where i come from by the grace of god
by the goodness of god look where i come from
remind me where i'm from again 
yeah that's right that's right
tryna suppress the stress you know

a father that needs fathering
a mom that would probably prefer the whole mother daughter thing but we still rolling you know
flipping my phone soon as i wake
they callin' my name just another day
can't bend can't break
can't let it show on my face
all of my mistakes right there on display
all part of my story skin thick as my shawty yeah 
flipping my phone soon as i wake
is everybody safe carrying the weight

the money in my safe can't buy a clean slate
clean isn't for me anyway
i don't want you to allow people to tell you that you are useless
alright alright go ahead and tell 'em go ahead and tell 'em
because i want you to know god told me to tell you this day you are useful 
you are valuable  and you are vital  to god
vital vital on baby on bible
remember what i left when i go
remember what i said when i spoke
please don't stand at my grave and cry though
i'm not there they made it so i can never really die though
so please don't stand at my grave and cry though
pop champagne scream my words
let me leave on a high note
and don't let nobody call me an idol
'cause i was never sitting idle
and my people go where i go
don't let nobody sell my house on the bridle
worked too hard for the title
worked too hard where did life go
last thing i heard was andre scream ice cold
past eight years feel like i had my eyes closed blindfolded
smoke before i make my decisions
that's how i take the high road
say i never get alone time that's a lie though
i'm still alone with everybody as far as i know
somebody remind me where i am
that's right im at home yeah im right where i belong
girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
this smoke is getting blown and these drinks are super strong
i know they ain't getting money like we do

tryna get the green like im waiting at a long light
broke just doesnt suit me girl and every night is prom night
whered i put my bow tie
millionaire multi

so someone please tell me the problem with my competition
i ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
i love from it though ive been down and i got up
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
and me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
because everything's easier to get into than get out off
but someone show me to the owner of this city
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me

the time will often pass
and something will remind me
i cant put this behind me
i thought you wouldve called by now by now
you couldve had my all by now by now
its been too many years for you to disappear
and have me asking the question
i wonder whatever became of you
although it's not that i'm surprised it's not i didn't try
it's not that i was frightened of you
although i said all goodbyes
and you had all your cries
i wonder whatever became of you
i wonder whatever became of you
i wonder whatever became of you
i swear i heard you call
but when i heard you'd gone
i hate that i looked desperate
you gone is like me naked
i'm steering not to crash
trying to make it last
keep looking close behind me
my eyesight on a memory
i thought you wouldve called by now by now
you could have all my love right now by now
gave into my fears
while you just disappeared
that's why i'm asking this question
i wonder whatever became of you
although it's not that i'm surprised it's not i didn't try
it's not that i was frightened of you
although i said all goodbyes
and you had all your cries
i wonder whatever became of you
i wonder whatever became of you
i wonder whatever became of you
i can't go to bed
i'm thinking about my goals
and how we used to say a goal is just a dream with a deadline
where did the other half of my heart go
why am i in bed alone
how come when i drive by it looks like you are never home
do you even live there
or did you take a u haul
too far move off and not even tell me that you're gone
we were on fire
somehow that fire cooled off burnt out
i kept straight but i wonder how you turned out
i wonder whatever became of you
although it's not that i'm surprised it's not i didn't try
it's not that i was frightened of you
although i said all goodbyes
and you had all your cries
i wonder whatever became of you
i wonder whatever became of you
i wonder whatever became of you

i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you

darling you
you give but you cannot take love
yeah i needed to hear that shit i hate when you're submissive
passive aggressive when we're texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
started realizing a couple places i could take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation that's lacking in patience
i've been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
we've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that nigga's amazing
well fuck it we had a couple coronas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child i'm in your zone
looking like you came from the 70's on your own
my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone
you don't even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something i'm missing and disappear when i'm bored
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh
i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you
you give but you cannot take love
i wish you could see
i love me
i love me enough for the both of us
that's why you trust me
i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you
what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you
you give but you cannot take love
shoulda spent more nights
coulda changed your life
we woulda been alright
all these shoulda coulda wouldas
in her ear one time
prolly wastin' my time
'cause she heard it all
'cause she heard it all
girl i coulda changed your life
but you heard it all
well i'ma say it anyway
shawty i'm from the city
where we were never taught to love
you ain't gotta be in love to fuck
girl i'm just tryna say
i'm from the city oh
where the money makes a difference
but it never made us different oh
uh uh uh
why are we in chanel talkin' 'bout life and shit
got my emotions on open mic and shit
fancy all this pink champagne on ice and shit
off one glass girl i can see how nice you get
buzzin' your body body to body
you said you're over me now you're all over me
buzzin' your body body to body
you said you're over me now you're all over me
i know you know i'm in too deep to let it go
i know you know its in my nature to get distant
i know it's been a year since i left you alone
unfortunate i think you know there's somethin' missin'
but you never say shit don't know how to take it
we're good on our own but

lyrics from snippets

you called me weak and you testing my manhood as we yell at each other
you wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you i love you
just know i can jeopardize both our reputations
despite what you said despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
you acting out you know you love to see a young nigga suffer
you you you know know know

i had an idea in my head
i pictured this going differently
i meant every word that i said
you should have spent more time listening
all the things that i put a hold on
all for you to hit me with a hold on
what makes you so ready right now
after i waited on you for so long
why you wanna be my love is it just for show
why you wanna be my love my love my love love
why you wanna be my love is it just for show

why you wanna be my love my love my love
why you wanna be my love my love my love
why you want to why you want to
why you want to why you want to

i pictured this going differently
even when you sleep in my bed
i know you're not mine officially
and all the things i put a hold on
all for you to hit me with a hold on
what makes you so ready right now
after i waited on you for so long
why you wanna be my love is it just for show
why you wanna be my love my love my love love
why you wanna be my love is it just for show
why you wanna be my love my love my love love
why you wanna be my love my love my love

why you want to why you want to
why you want to why you want to
why you want to why you want to
why you want to why you want to
what you doin' what you doin' to me
you know that you got me
you got me where you want me
you know what you doin'
nah nah i don't want you to stop
come here
go
never been a people person always been a people's person
know how to get a person don't know how to keep a person yeah
but you know everybody need somebody
and everybody ain't gon' be somebody
i mean it's been like twenty years since my mother has seen somebody
i'm convinced that she thinks that's it's too late or somethin'
i should try and set her up on a date or somethin'
you deserve love how long are you gon' wait for somethin'
nah we gon find you someone doin' some
someone rich and single is lionel richie single
haha okay i'm jokin' i'm kiddin' i'm playin'
at least tell me that you hear all this shit that i'm sayin'
i don't wanna be the only man you laugh with
life is quick you should start it happy and end it happy
she ask me are you and happy
i never told you what ended up happenin'
as i pretend you haven't made a mess
of this young man it's crazy how i degress
and now you got the best of me 
don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
and now you got the best of me 
don't worry 'bout the rest of me
oh the world is far from perfect
'cause i only think of you
but i feel like it is worth it
everything's movin' in slow motion
movin' in slow motion
you smile at me i act like i'm not impressed
you ain't too please in a place that i can't protest
and now you got the best of me 
don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
and now you got the best of me 
don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
inside is bliss but outside my world's a wreck
'cause every time that you pass me
i can't help but turn my neck
and now you got the best of me 
don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
and now you got the best of me 
don't worry 'bout the rest of me 
oh the world is far from perfect
'cause i only think of you 
but i feel like it is worth it
everything's movin' in slow motion
it's movin' in slow motion 
i feel so undeservin'  of the mere presence of you 
and my vision it gets blurry 
everything's movin' in slow motion 
movin' in slow motion 
i started believin' that crazy shit she told me
not sure if that makes me crazy or just lonely
then i got bored because fightin' is boring
and she was gone soon as i started stallin'
i don't want it except for when i want it
and even then i beat myself up for it
that's when you hear me say i'm movin' on from it
but it's obviously something else that i want from it
and then that's how she goes about it
it's hard to act like you want it when you know you got it
i'm textin' and callin' like that's my true callin'
and the only time that she's really talking
is when you she tells me about myself like that's what's important
startin' things over nothin' that shit is overwhelmin'
her main problem is she always think i'm up to somethin'
and shit talking 'bout it make me wanna fuckin' call her
reverse psychology whatever you call it
but to answer the question yeah i think we're happy
we're always reunited that's a good thing i guess
we're always startin' over that shit always seems excitin'
i don't know i guess it's yet to be seen
she's busy doin' her and i'm out here chasin' the dream
honestly we say a lot of things that we don't mean
start happy end happy with the summer in between slow motion
oh the world is far from perfect
'cause i only think of you 
but i feel like it is worth it
everything movin' in slow motion
it's movin' in slow motion 
lyrics from snippet
all i gotta do is put my mind to this shit
i like all my exes 
uh uh yeah
uh
i wanna be together when they say that they know somebody better
i just hope you stay down uh
i just hope you stay down yeah
i just hope you stay
and girl i know you got your spies when they happen to catch me in a lie
i just hope you stay down yeah
i just hope you stay down
i just hope you stay
look i'm sorry that i'm super late
i was drivin' here jammin' them lil boosie tapes
understand that i do not envision i hallucinate
i'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate but
let's talk about the babies me and you could make
we could do it anywhere baby you just choose the place
i hope i'm not being inappropriate
but maybe if i peak under the table you could show me it
let me get a quickie speed stick no deodorant
to cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
when you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
but even with a bunch of women you could be the loneliest
i tend to ask more than i can give
or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
that's probably why i'm keepin' you around
was looking for exactly what i found
i just hope you stay down
babygirl i hope you rep for me for real
and when they get to stereotypin' a nigga
i just hope you stay down uh
i just hope you stay down
i just hope you stay
listen even if you slightly doubt me
when these bitches start to writin' books about me
i just hope you stay down yeah
i just hope you stay down yeah
i just hope you stay
everything about me cataclysmic
big obscure on every characteristic
i don't know what you're used to but i'm a little different
tremendous with credentials resume is so prolific
enough of that despite i'm promisin' one in the booth
always been a specialist at messin' with the best forbidden fruit
never did i witness beauty so amazin' get it to the point when i see her she glowin' like an angel with it
but after all the years of doin' it i need an understanding with a woman good with followin' my lead
and though she finds it sexy and she loves that i'm the power even in a crowded room discreetly touching on her private
and when we goin' through a moment when we feelin' iffy
believe in shit you hearin' while i question if you with me
you see that line of chicks let's go around the corner waitin' and hopin' you drown i just hope you stay down
i can't help the women lovin' everything about me why you passin' judgement
i just hope you stay down yeah
i just hope you stay down
i just hope you stay
i know it's hard to trust me all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me
i just hope you stay down uh
i just hope you stay down
i just hope you stay

whippin' up dope scientist

addin' up checks no minus
get your respect in diamonds 
i bought a plain jane rollie
these niggas bought they fame 
i think my back got scoliosis 'cause i swerve the lane 
heard you signed your life for that brand new chain 
think it came with stripes
but you ain't straight with the gang
